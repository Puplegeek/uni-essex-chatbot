## Our research can transform your business

Essex has a successful track record of delivering innovative and disruptive projects with industry.

From award-winning [Knowledge Transfer Partnerships](https://www.essex.ac.uk/business/expertise/knowledge-transfer-partnerships) (KTPs) to [consultancy](https://www.essex.ac.uk/business/expertise/commissioned-and-collaborative-research-projects/consultancy) and [contract research](https://www.essex.ac.uk/business/expertise/commissioned-and-collaborative-research-projects), we're sharing our expertise and innovating business.

### Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs)

#### We're number 1 in the UK for the number of Innovate UK funded KTPs

[Knowledge Transfer Partnerships](https://www.essex.ac.uk/business/expertise/knowledge-transfer-partnerships) are part-government-funded collaborations between universities and businesses.

We have successfully secured more Innovate UK KTP funding than any other university in the East of England or London (and we're number 1 in the UK). You could access up to 75% of project costs through this program. Essex will lead the entire process and have a sector-leading track record in winning this funding. All projects are commercially driven and underpinned by world-class research from Essex.

Come to us with an issue and we'll identify one of our academic teams to work with you and recruit a high-calibre graduate who will be based in your company as an associate to manage the project.

### Innovate UK Accelerated Knowledge Transfer (AKT)

This new programme from Innovate UK has been designed to create short-term collaborations between a business and a UK Knowledge Base, such as the University of Essex, to rapidly inject innovation capacity.

 

Inspired by the highly successful Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) model, the aim of **Accelerated Knowledge Transfer** (AKT) is to deliver a fast and targeted collaboration to accelerate the evaluation or development of an innovation project or concept, which has the potential for significant impact for the Business Partner.

 

The programme offers grand funding of up to £35,000 per project for collaborations lasting two to four months.

### Commissioned and collaborative research

**How it works**

You can work with us in one of two ways.

* If you need research in an area that you don't have expertise in yourself, or simply don't have sufficient resource to commit to a project, commission us to conduct a research project for you.
* Your experts can collaborate with ours on strategic, funded projects of significance to your industry.

#### Commissioned research

You can commission our University's researchers to work on specific problems or opportunities. We have expertise in a number of key areas that allows us to deliver real benefits to businesses of all types and sizes, across a range of sectors.

#### Collaborative research

Collaborative research projects involve at least two collaborators, one of which is your business. They are funded by a range of organisations including research councils, trusts, charities and Innovate UK. These organisations support universities and industry to work together on strategically significant projects. We have a great deal of experience of working on collaborative projects and can help you access funding.

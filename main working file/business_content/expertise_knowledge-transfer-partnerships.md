## Innovation for business

Do you want to innovate by developing new products or services, or improve existing processes? A Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Essex can boost profitability and give your business a competitive advantage.

## What is a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP)?

A KTP is a three-way collaboration between a business or not-for-profit organisation, an academic team and a qualified graduate. The project can last between 1 to 3 years.

Funded by [Innovate UK](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/) and Research Councils, KTPs are an established and successful initiative to drive innovation and growth through the transfer of expertise from a university to an external business. They help you explore a new idea or strategy by adding the outside expertise you need. And with up to 75% of the project cost funded, KTPs take the risk out of your innovation strategy.

From scoping through to funding wins, and recruitment of high-quality talent to project completion, we support our business collaborations every step of the way.

## The KTP process

Follow our six simple steps below to help you understand if KTPs are right for your company.

### 1. Contact us

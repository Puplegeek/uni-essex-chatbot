## Get your business ready for take-off!

Innovation vouchers can provide your small or medium-sized business with funding to engage with our university expertise, with the opportunity to foster a long-term partnership. Funds pay for our academic experts to provide you with tailored consultancy.

We can help you with:

* scoping or developing new products
* solving problems
* developing your employees
* carrying out a feasibility study
* scoping a new business idea
* improving business efficiency
* exploring other ways to stimulate your company's growth

### University of Essex Innovation Vouchers

Our £10,000 University of Essex business innovation voucher can be used for projects in any field. Contact us and we'll guide you through the application process. We'll discuss your company's needs so you can complete and submit your application, which will be reviewed by our business panel.

If accepted, you can reclaim costs of up to £10,000 excluding VAT on completion of your project.
We'll assess applications based on the scope of the project, the value of the project to your business and on the potential your business has to work with us in the future.

### Eligibility

You can apply for a voucher if your business has:

* fewer than 250 employees
* an annual turnover of less than £25.9 million
* no other enterprises holding 25% or more of your company's capital or voting rights

Priority will be given to businesses that have not previously worked with us.

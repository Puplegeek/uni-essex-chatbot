## Meet some of our partners

Find out about some of the projects that have received an innovation boost thanks to the unique Innovate to Elevate accelerator programme led by the University of Essex in partnership with Babergh and Mid Suffolk District Councils.

### Orbital Media: Developing DementiaSim – a new Proof of Concept platform supporting carers of those with dementia.

  
Stowmarket based Orbital Media create digital service delivery solutions with significant expertise in software development, AI, app development, user experience and software design.  
  
Partnering with Dr Mary Kennedy and colleagues from Essex’s School of Health and Social Care, this project will develop a series of films for Orbital’s proposed DementiaSim platform and create a Proof of Concept app which aims to support those caring for people with dementia in navigating everyday situations.  
  
**Hayden Allen-Vercoe, Chief Operating Officer from Orbital Media** comments: *“DementiaSim incorporates true to life footage, presented in a fully immersive 360 VR format. The video content is fully interactive, allowing for users to make decisions and see the outcomes, be them good or bad – we retain 80% of what we see, compared to 20% of what we read and only 10% of what we hear. Our ambition is to help prepare thousands of families for the debilitating onset of the disease, by providing clear guidance around the right protocol”.*

### Project Orange: Encouraging more eco-friendly behaviours via community engagement.

  
Project Orange is an architectural and interior design practice and since moving their HQ to Lavenham, they’ve become engaged with the local community, including the Neighbourhood Planning Group.  
  
The company will work with Dr Nicholas Beuret from Essex Business School to engage with the community in Lavenham and encourage residents to be more eco-friendly. This will include supporting behaviour change around home heating and cooling; everyday actions and behaviours to reduce in energy bills; harnessing the collective purchasing power of the community to commission products with which to retrofit their homes; and considering the effects of overheating with hotter summers due to climate change.  
  
The project will lead to a better understanding of the perceived and actual barriers rural communities face when adopting sustainability-related behaviours and actions in their homes. This insight will provide Project Orange with a blueprint for engaging with such communities in future.   
  
**James Soane, Director at Project Orange** says: *“We are delighted to be collaborating with the University of Essex on this forward-looking programme. It will help us and the community in tackling some of the climate emergency challenges we are all facing.”*

It will explore the company’s strengths and weaknesses in their current marketing and sales activities and understand blockers to growth. The project will establish the foundations for a new marketing and digital marketing strategy for the business.  
  
**Mick Waring, Sales Director at Braiswick Photographic** said: *“We’re looking forward to working with Dr Akram and are grateful for the opportunity to learn from an expert this field. The discussions so far have given us great enthusiasm to progress with this project.”*

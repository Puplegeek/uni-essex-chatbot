## Business context

Changing Lives Community Services is a Non-Profit Community Interest Company that provides access to physical activity for the community and through sports aims to prevent children and young people from getting involved in anti-social behaviour and gang-related activity.

The company runs Changing Lives FC. Based in Harlow, Essex, the club is a football squad made up entirely of migrant, asylum seeker or refugee players. It was formed to improve the wellbeing and social integration of this marginalised group and to challenge negative narratives around migrants and refugees by providing an opportunity for them to interact with the wider community through competitive football.

The club provides these young people with a chance to socialise, have fun and exercise while forming long-lasting bonds through the medium of sport. They play in the Essex Alliance League, Step 7, competing against other teams playing high-quality football.

Changing Lives has seen first-hand the positive effect taking part in competitive football has on their players, but they had no way of demonstrating this impact. The company needed to develop new ways of measuring the benefits experienced by their players to be able to communicate them to their supporters and funders.

## Research Solution

Through an Innovate UK funded [Accelerated Knowledge Transfer (AKT)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/business/expertise/funding-opportunities/accelerated-knowledge-transfer) project, Changing Lives partnered with [Dr Chris McManus](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/MCMAN21401/Christopher-McManus), an expert in measuring the impact of sport and exercise on wellbeing and performance, from Essex’s [School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Science.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/school-of-sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences)

 

Alongside Research Assistant [Jenson Taylor](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/TAYLO22100), Dr McManus and Dr Alison Swartz collected a series of data points from the Changing Lives players to look at their wellbeing and the impact playing competitive football was having on their lives.

 

The tests included physical measurements conducted at Essex’s cutting-edge Human Performance Unit, as well as surveys and interviews designed to explore the players’ mental and emotional wellbeing. 

 

The academic team analysed all the data gathered using the latest techniques to produce a report summarising the findings, setting out the evidence for their conclusions and making recommendations about next steps and ways to improve.

## Business value

The results of the research show that playing with Changing Lives FC has a positive impact on the players’ health and wellbeing, with Changing Lives now able to use the report produced by the academic team to show funders and supporters that they are delivering a positive impact through their work.

 

The findings from the report are being included in grant applications and have helped Changing Lives to secure new contracts with their commissioners. Not only that, the report makes recommendations about steps Changing Lives could take to improve their activities even further to enhance the benefits for the players.

 

The project has given Changing Lives the skills needed to continue monitoring their impact, which will help them to improve their activities and support future funding applications.

> "Working with Dr McManus and the team at Essex has had a massive impact on Changing Lives. We're using the findings to secure the club's future with funding applications, and the players have gained a lot from taking part. Being part of the research study made them feel valued and part of something important. We're looking forward to continuing the partnership with Essex.

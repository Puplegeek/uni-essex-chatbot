## Accelerating Innovation

Do you need support to quickly identify innovation opportunities or challenges? Perhaps you need a proof of concept before embarking on larger scale projects, or want a data set assessed for AI readiness? An Accelerated Knowledge Transfer with Essex could be your answer.

## Introducing Accelerated Knowledge Transfer (AKT)

**Accelerated Knowledge Transfer (AKT)** is a programme from Innovate UK that sees **funds distributed to businesses and organisations** looking to innovate or develop new and disruptive capabilities.

 

The programme is designed to create short-term collaborations between a business and a UK Knowledge Base, such as the University of Essex, to rapidly inject innovation capacity with grant funding of **up to £35,000 per project**.

 

AKT's are inspired by the highly successful Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) model and aims to deliver a **targeted** **collaboration lasting between two to four months** that accelerates the evaluation or development of an innovation project or concept, which has the potential for significant impact for a business or organisation.

### AKT Round 4 Funding Call | Addiction Healthcare Goals | May 2025

Innovate UK’s AKT Round 4 will focus on the thematic area of **Addiction Healthcare Goals** with up to £2m available in total to support the AKT projects in this round.

* Competition **opens on 12 May 2025** and **closes on 2 July 2025**.

Projects supported by the Addiction Healthcare Goals AKT fund will explore questions linked to **treatment of, recovery from, and reduction or prevention of harm by addictions or dependence to substances treated in a typical treatment service in the UK.**

Examples of topics within the scope for this AKT call include, but are not limited to:

* Piloting approaches to improve researcher access to treatment and recovery services and settings.
* Devising methods for improving treatment data collection, processing and availability for research.
* Developing optimal methods to engage people with lived and living experience in research and/or treatment pathway design.
* Exploring approaches to enhance awareness and openness of people with lived and living experience to use new technologies, treatments and approaches.
* Investigating barriers and devising solutions to the roll out of new treatments and technologies by service providers.
* Improving pathways linking substance use treatment and recovery services to mental health and physical health treatment, and to wider social, criminal justice and other relevant systems.

If you are an organisation or academic with an innovative idea to improve treatment, recovery, and harm prevention for those with drug and/or alcohol addiction(s), get in touch today to find out how we can partner with you on this new funding opportunity.

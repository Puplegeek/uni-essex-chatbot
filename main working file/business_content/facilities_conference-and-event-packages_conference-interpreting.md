## UN-standard language facilities

We're the only university in the UK to provide translation, interpreting and subtitling expertise covering a number of languages.

Our combination of conference interpreting facilities are unique to the east of England. When you hire our labs you can either use our interpreters or bring your own.

### Interpreting lab

Book our new state-of-the-art interpreting lab for your next multi-lingual meeting, conference or trade show. It has ten booths to interpret conferences involving up to 20 people and equipment matching that of the European Commission, the United Nations and the Houses of Parliament.

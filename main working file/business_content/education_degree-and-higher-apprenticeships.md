Degree and higher apprenticeships

# High-calibre apprenticeships

## Boost your business with Higher and Degree Apprenticeships

Apprenticeships combine on-the-job training and academic study.

Designed by employers for employers by [Trailblazer Groups](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/developing-new-apprenticeships/forming-a-trailblazer-group/), our apprenticeships are industry-focused and driven.

Apprenticeships offer employers a highly affordable way to invest in new talent, reskill or upskill existing workforce (CPD).

Apprenticeships represent an ideal combination of on-the-job training and academic study, providing higher-level qualifications, including degrees, boosting your business with a skilled and qualified workforce.

Whether you're an employer who needs to develop skilled and qualified employees or a prospective apprentice who wants a head-start in the workplace, we'll guide you through your options.

We currently offer apprenticeships in the following areas:

* Health and Social Care
* Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences Apprenticeships

Discover the benefits of apprenticeships:

* Benefits for your business
* The Apprenticeship Levy

### Advanced Clinical Practitioner Degree Apprenticeship

# About the course and qualification

Your employees will be able to study our [Advanced Clinical Practitioner (ACP) Degree Apprenticeship](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/advanced-clinical-practitioner-degree/) at either our Colchester or Southend campus. We’ve carefully planned this apprenticeship to work flexibly around their professional needs and commitments to maximise the benefits to you both.

This programme is accredited by Health Education England's Centre for Advancing Practice.

This apprenticeship is suitable for health care professionals from a range of backgrounds, including nursing and midwifery, as well as allied health professions such as pharmacy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. Your staff may already be working in an advanced role but require professional qualifications, or you may be looking to develop their skills set to enable progression to an ACP role.

Time away from their normal clinical role to study will need to be given as part of the apprenticeship to fulfil the 20% off the job training hours.

Although ‘Advanced Clinical Practitioner’ is not currently a regulated title, it is expected to be in the near future using the national Multi-Professional Framework for Advanced Clinical Practice as the criteria to be able to register on a data base of ACPs.

The apprenticeship is underpinned by the national framework for advanced clinical practice which means that as well as gaining the MSc Advanced Clinical Practitioner qualification, on completion, your employee/s will also be eligible to apply for ACP roles. Depending on the modules chosen they will gain skills in leadership, critical thinking and clinical decision-making, as well as enhanced knowledge of specific areas of specialist clinical practice.

See our [apprenticeship pages](https://www.essex.ac.uk/apprenticeships/health-and-social-care-apprenticeships#advanced-clinical-practitioner-degree-apprenticeship) for more information on the course modules, course structure, entry requirements and School facilities.

## The Apprenticeship Levy

### What you need to know

* If your annual pay bill exceeds £3 million, you'll pay 0.5% of your pay bill less a £15,000 annual allowance.
* That money, plus a 10% top-up provided by the government, will go into a dedicated account for your company to use to pay for apprentice training - your Digital Apprenticeship Service account.
* Money in your account will expire after 24 months if it hasn't been used.

You can get more detail on the Apprenticeship Levy from the Education and Skills Funding Agency. We can help you plan your apprenticeship strategy and how to make the best use of your levy contribution. Contact us to find out more. We can also advise on other grants that may be available.

### Non-Levy Paying Employers

From January 2020 all employers who do not pay the apprenticeship levy (those who have a pay bill under £3 million) are now able to create accounts on the apprenticeship service and are also able to:

* Choose from a range of apprenticeship standards;
* Choose a provider from the Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers (RoATP) to deliver apprenticeship training;
* Find an End-Point Assessment Organisation (EPAO);
* Reserve access to funding for apprenticeship training and assessment;
* Agree contracts with providers; and
* Benefit from collaborative relationships by delegating permissions to providers to service their accounts.
* Employers who do not pay the apprenticeship levy are required to reserve funds through the apprenticeship service before an apprenticeship can commence.
* As a non-levy-employer you will be required to fund 5% of the training fee with the Government funding the remaining 95% of the fee.

### Apprenticeship Levy Transfers

### Essex County Council Levy Transfer

Essex County Council are striving to increase apprenticeships within the county. The Council's new [Essex Apprenticeship Levy Transfer Service](https://www.essexalts.co.uk) will allow levy payers to utilise levy to support the apprenticeship training costs for other organisations. This is an online service that allows companies interested in donating apprenticeship levy funds (maximum of 25%), to view details of opportunities created by other organisations looking for funding. Organisations can specify their objectives and based on these are matched with other appropriate organisations. The online system makes the process easy and there is also a dedicated team to support during this process.

The service also helps SMEs to source a levy transfer for their apprentice(s).  By registering for free on their site, you can create an opportunity which will be shown to levy donors who are also registered.  Although there is no guarantee that a levy transfer match will take place, registering will mean that your requirements are given maximum exposure to potential donors.

Find out more about the [Essex Apprenticeship Levy Transfer Service](https://www.essexalts.co.uk) or [contact the team directly.](mailto:info@essexalts.co.uk) 

### Co-op Levy Transfer

**How will this help my organisation to donate Levy?**

Co-op Levy Share will allow large employers to utilise their levy to support smaller businesses, whether that be developing your supply chain, forming strategic partnerships or demonstrating corporate social responsibility. Large employers will have exposure to numerous opportunities that they wouldn't have known existed without the site

**How will Co-op Levy Share help me if I am looking for a transfer?**

By connecting with levy paying organisations you could benefit from fully funded apprenticeship training without needing to pay co-investment costs (funding criteria apply). You will be able to showcase your opportunity to a large national audience, in a straightforward forward simple way by registering on this site and creating your opportunity.

Find out more about the [Co-op Apprenticeship Levy Transfer scheme](https://cooplevyshare.co.uk/)

## Advertise your apprenticeship vacancies

#### National Apprenticeship Service

All apprenticeship vacancies should be advertised on the Find an Apprenticeship website as those still in education are being encouraged to register and receive updates on newly listed vacancies in the area they are interested in. The service is free and is the official job site for apprenticeships in England managed by the National Apprenticeship Service enabling your vacancy to be viewed and applied for nationally by candidates who register onto the website making it an easy and convenient way to attract and recruit apprentices. You can, of course, continue to advertise your vacancy on your own website.

We can upload your vacancy details for you, should you wish: you just need to provide a Job Description and Personal Specification (we can even assist you with templates should you need them) and, although the decision making process is employer led, we can manage the application process by checking applicants entry criteria and eligibility before you shortlist against your own requirements and invite applicants to interview.

#### University of Essex CareerHub vacancy board

Careers Services manage the University of Essex CareerHub vacancy board, which is a free service for organisations to advertise opportunities to both our current students and recent graduates. Once details are uploaded vacancies are usually published within 24 working hours.

Please contact the Apprenticeship Team if you have a vacancy you wish to advertise at: [apprenticeships@essex.ac.uk](mailto:apprenticeships@essex.ac.uk) and we can discuss options and next steps.

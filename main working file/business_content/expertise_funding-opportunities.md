## Innovate UK funding

### Start a Knowledge Transfer Partnership with us

**We're number 1 in the UK for the number of Innovate UK funded KTPs**

[Knowledge Transfer Partnerships](https://www.essex.ac.uk/business/expertise/knowledge-transfer-partnerships) are part-government-funded collaborations between universities and businesses.

Come to us with an issue and we'll identify one of our academic teams to work with you and recruit a high-calibre graduate who will be based in your company as an associate to manage the project.

KTPs can last up to three years and you could access around £150,000 through this program.

We have more KTPs than any other university in the UK, helping more businesses across the country gain a competitive advantage and ultimately improve their profitability.

### **Innovate UK Accelerated Knowledge Transfer (AKT)**

 

After a successful pilot scheme in 2022, this new programme from Innovate UK has been designed to create short-term collaborations between a business and a UK Knowledge Base, such as the University of Essex, to rapidly inject innovation capacity.

 

Inspired by the highly successful Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) model, the aim of **Accelerated Knowledge Transfer** (AKT) is to deliver a rapid and targeted collaboration to accelerate the evaluation or development of an innovation project or concept, which has the potential for significant impact for the Business Partner.

 

The programme offers grand funding of **up to £35,000 per project** for collaborations lasting two to four months.

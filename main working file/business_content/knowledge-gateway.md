The Knowledge Gateway's [Innovation Centre](https://www.essex.ac.uk/business/knowledge-gateway/innovation-centre) provides the space plus the vital hands-on support to help 50 start-ups and small businesses scale-up and succeed plus it is also home to a state-of-the-art creative digital studio, Studio X.

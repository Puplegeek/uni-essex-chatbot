The details

Course: 
Sociology

UCAS code: 
L300

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
3 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Sociology and Criminology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sociology)

What holds societies together? Do people pull together because they have to or because they want to? What motivates so many people to migrate from their own societies to others? On our course you explore why individuals, groups, and cultures are the way they are, and examine why they might be different.

At Essex we investigate what connects people with each other, as well as what divides them. You can study topics such as digital media and society, psychiatry and mental illness, sexualities, crime, childhood, and the art, film and personal testimony of war.

We are a large and friendly department, offering a range and diversity of specialisms including:

* Social divisions, inequality, the nature of work and commercial culture* Culture, identity and subjectivity* Public policy regarding health, the environment, crime and aging* Citizenship, multiculturalism and human rights* Receive training in sociological methods – how to design a survey, conduct an interview, and use quantitative analysis from basic statistic to big data – in order to ask the difficult questions

You also have the opportunity to complete a supervised dissertation on the topic that most inspires you, encouraging you to think differently and connect with live issues and debates, and preparing you for your graduate career.

We are 2nd in UK for research power in sociology (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021) and we’re ranked 73rd globally and top 15 in the UK for sociology in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2024.

Why we're great.

* Our teaching is underpinned by research - new ideas and theories are tested in the classroom.
* You acquire a range of skills valued by employers including research, interpreting data and debating.
* You develop the critical and inventive thinking skills necessary for many graduate jobs.

### Study abroad

Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.

Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.

If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university

### Placement year

You can also undertake a placement year in which you gain relevant work experience within an external business, giving you a competitive edge in the graduate job market and providing you with key contacts within the industry. You will be responsible for finding your placement, but with support and guidance provided by both your department and our Employability and Careers Centre.

### Training social scientists of the future

Through our Q-Step Affiliate Status, we offer you the opportunity to follow a [specialised pathway](http://www.essex.ac.uk/ss/employability/q-step.aspx) that embeds quantitative methods in your degree. Successful completion of specified modules entitles you to receive the qualifier ‘(Applied Quantitative Methods)' at the end of your degree title, for example BA Sociology (Applied Quantitative Methods) and this will appear on your transcript. You can also receive student bursaries to go on work placements, helping you stand out when applying for jobs.

If you complete a placement year you'll only pay 20% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year.

### Our expert staff

You are taught by a team of award-winning internationally renowned scholars widely regarded as leading experts in their fields.

Our academics believe in doing research that matters and makes a difference; whether it's the battle between big data and human rights or the policing of sex workers, we embed our innovative and sometimes controversial research into your course.

As well as publishing core texts and bestselling books, our academics often appear on TV and radio. Recent examples include Professor Mike Roper on The Psychology of War for the BBC World Service and Professor Pam Cox in her BBC TWO series Shopgirls: The True Story of Life Behind the Counter. Others engage with politics and policy making, such as those running our specialist centres for Migration Studies and Criminology.

Core staff on this programme include:

* **Dr Tara Mahfoud**

  Trained in sociology and anthropology, Dr Tara Mahfoud's research explores the cultural, social and political contexts and implications of developments in the neurosciences. She has worked with scientists to develop responsible research and innovation practices, and her research has been used to inform international policy on neurotechnology.
* **Professor Michael Halewood**

  Professor Michael Halewood works at the intersection of sociology and philosophy. His recent work has looked at language, psychedelics, and aesthetics. More recently, he has focussed on questions of morality and sociality. His current project asks whether Sociology is a Moral Science? In addressing this question, he wants to think about whether Sociology can or should try to influence how people act.
* **Dr Maitrayee Deka**

  Dr Maitrayee Deka's research focuses on Economic Sociology, Consumer Cultures and Social Theory. Maitrayee looks at alternative systems to global capitalism, stemming from her interest in global bazaar economies and her ethnography in Delhi's Electronic Bazaars. The other strand of Maitrayee's research looks at marginal cultural spaces, specifically young adults' social media use in the Global South.
* **Dr Carlos Gigoux**

  Dr Carlos Gigoux is the Deputy Director of our Centre for Migration Studies. He participates in the Essex Migrant Agency Forum that brings together organizations that supports Asylum Seekers, Refugees and Migrants in the East of England. He is a member the Sanctuary University Network and has also advised parliamentary bodies on refugee and asylum policy, most recently the [Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman](https://www.ombudsman.org.uk/).

### Specialist facilities

* A unique Student Study Centre where you can get help with your studies, access examples of previous students' work, and attend workshops on research skills* The common room is open all day Monday-Friday, has a hot drinks vending machine, water cooler and microwave as well as a small number of lockers available* Links with the Institute of Social and Economic Research, which conducts large-scale survey projects and has its own library, and the UK Data Archive, which stores national research data like the British Crime Survey* Our students' [Sociology Society](https://www.essexstudent.com/organisation/7170/), a forum for the exchange of ideas, arranging talks by visiting speakers, introducing you to various career pathways, and organising debates

### Your future

A good sociology course, especially one from a recognised centre of excellence like Essex, can open many doors.

Sociology students are in demand from a wide range of employers in a host of occupations, including local and central government, NGOs, social work, market research, project management, fundraising, auditing, marketing, case-work, youth and community work, voluntary sector management and lobbying.

Our recent graduates have gone on to work for a wide range of high-profile companies including:

* The Institute of Public Finance* Guardian Professional* United* Synergy Healthcare Research

We also work with the University's [Student Development Team](http://www.essex.ac.uk/careers) to help you find out about further work experience, internships, placements, and voluntary opportunities.

> “Prior to coming to Essex, I discovered how highly ranked the Department of Sociology was for student satisfaction and research. I attended an open day and discovered for myself what Essex could offer me – I knew then this was a place I could see myself studying at. I now work for the registered charity, Essex Coalition of Disabled People, and every day I feel like I can help people in my job and use the skills gained throughout my degree.”

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

### Applying

Applications for our full-time undergraduate courses should be made through the [Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.com/). Full details on how to apply can be found on the [filling in your UCAS undergraduate application](https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/applying-university/filling-your-ucas-undergraduate-application) web page.

Our UK students, and some of our EU and international students, who are still at school or college, can apply through their school. Your school will be able to check and then submit your completed application to UCAS. Our other international applicants (EU or worldwide) or independent applicants in the UK can also apply online through UCAS Apply.

The UCAS code for our University of Essex is **ESSEX E70**. The individual campus codes for our Loughton and Southend Campuses are 'L' and 'S' respectively.

You can find further information on how to apply, including information on transferring from another university, applying if you are not currently at a school or college, and applying for readmission on our [How to apply and entry requirements](https://www.essex.ac.uk/undergraduate/applying-to-essex) page.

### Offer Holder Days

If you receive an undergraduate offer to study with us in October 2026 and live in the UK, you will receive an email invitation to book onto one of our Offer Holder Days. Our Colchester Campus Offer Holder Days run in Spring 2026 on various Wednesdays and Saturdays, and our Southend Campus event will also run in Spring 2026. These events provide the opportunity to meet your department, tour our campus and accommodation, and chat to current students. Please visit our [Offer Holder Days webpage](https://www.essex.ac.uk/visit-us/offer-holder-days) for more information, including terms and conditions.

If you are an overseas offer-holder, you are more than welcome to join us at one of our in-person Offer Holder Days if you are able to - we will let you know in your invite email how you can do this. If you can't make it, we will provide plenty of opportunities to get a feel for life at Essex, virtually.

Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our [programme specifications](http://www.essex.ac.uk/programmespecs/). The University would inform and engage with you if your course was to be discontinued, and would provide you with options, where appropriate, in line with our Compensation and Refund Policy.*

The details

Course: 
Acting (International)

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
East15 (Loughton) Campus

Based in: 
[East 15 Acting School](https://www.east15.ac.uk/)

East 15 Acting School's MA Acting (International) is a conservatoire-style, industry-focused professional training programme, designed specifically for international students looking to train in the UK.

Through this intensive programme, you'll master a wide spectrum of core acting skills. You'll receive classes in acting techniques, movement (drawn from Laban, Feldenkrais, Somatic, and Grotowski techniques), voice production, articulation, RP (Received Pronunciation), and singing. You'll also have the option to take additional Stage Combat classes in the evenings.

Throughout the course, you'll receive individual feedback, guidance, and support from your acting tutors as well as skills tutors.

The advanced acting training offered on this course draws on contemporary industry practices as well as the legacy of Stanislavski. It also incorporates East 15's unique methodologies and ethos, which shape our approach to actor training. Our ethos grew out of the techniques, beliefs, and practices of Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop, one of the UK's most historically significant theatre companies of the 20th century.

##### On the MA Acting (International), you will have opportunities to:

* Undertake a six-week intensive study of Shakespeare, including a three-week residency at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. Your residency culminates in a performance on the Globe stage to an invited public audience.
* Learn advanced physical skills and vocal techniques, alongside rigorous training in all aspects of acting. Our unique approach also emphasises the use of detailed research and targeted improvisation, with direct application to text, character creation and scene work.
* Perform in two technically supported, publicly ticketed shows. These shows are staged at our  [Corbett Theatre](http://www.east15.ac.uk/loughton) and promoted to the industry.
* Professionally film a Showreel and record a Voicereel, which are included in the *MA Acting (International) Online Showcase*, intended to promote you to members of industry in the UK and abroad.
* Stage a studio-scale performance of a collaboratively Devised full-length show at the School, performed to an invited public audience.
* Undertake writing workshops, leading to a Solo Theatre performance in our  [Corbett Theatre](http://www.east15.ac.uk/loughton).
* Take part in professional development workshops and masterclasses.
* Collaborate with our [MFA Theatre Directing](http://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg00830/2/mfa-theatre-directing) students for modules on Brecht, Improvisation and Comedy.

At East 15, we regard every actor as unique, recognising the need for different keys to unlock your capabilities as artists and individuals. Our training emphasises positivity, passion, and professionalism, creating a truly safe space in which you can learn and explore to your fullest.

You'll work with highly experienced professional practitioners and directors alongside an international cohort of actors from all over the world. This rich mix of diverse cultural backgrounds, historical perspectives, and life experiences will enlighten, challenge, and educate you, both as an artist and as a human being.

You'll learn to create truthful, three-dimensional characters with emotional depth and veracity, and work with sophisticated texts in various genres and styles. Our training takes a holistic approach to building character and interpreting narrative, making it ideal for students interested in the craft of acting and performance.

By the time you graduate, you'll be a confident, self-sufficient actor, fully in control of your process and ready to work with any director, any genre, and any discipline.

--

The MA Acting (International) course runs for 12 months on a full-time basis. We accept about 22 students each year into this programme.

You'll undertake Acting for Camera classes, Showreel filming, Voicereel recording, Writing Workshops, and your Solo Theatre public performance solely with your MA Acting (International) cohort, typically in two groups of 11 or 12.

In the early stages of the course, MA Acting (International) students are combined with first-year MFA Acting (International) students for most modules, working in three groups of 14 to 16 students. The composition of these groups change after each module in response to your individual needs and future journey as an actor. This flexible structure allows you greater choice in selecting texts, projects, tutors, and directors for your modules, supporting your personalised development.

This course is taught at our picturesque [Loughton Campus](https://www.east15.ac.uk/loughton).

## Structure

### Course structure

At East 15, our training draws upon over 60 years of tradition, combined with a keen sense of the world of stage and screen today. Our carefully selected modules will give you the chance to explore and develop your specialist training.

In a typical week, you'll spend around half your time in Acting class, with the remainder focused on Voice, Articulation, Movement, and Singing classes. We believe in a holistic approach to training, so your Voice, Articulation, and Movement classes are usually connected to the project you are working on in your Acting class.

*We know that choosing where and what to study is a big decision. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services, and facilities as described on our website and in your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes (for example, due to a significant disruption) we'll let our students and applicants know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

### Teaching

##### Term 1

###### Character and Scene Study

In the first term, you'll focus on acting techniques evolved from the Stanislavski tradition, using extensive improvisational exercises to explore East 15's core approach to actor training. This enables students from diverse traditions and approaches to establish a shared language and process in preparation for subsequent training.

The focus then shifts to applying what you have learned in the initial improvised exercises to text. Through our intensive, detailed approach to text analysis, research, and targeted improvisation, you'll enhance your ability to bring characters and situations to life. You'll also deepen your process in the rehearsal and performance of naturalistic scenes. This module utilises naturalistic scripts: from Chekhov and Ibsen to Hansberry and Rattigan.

The first term ends with a collaboration with our MA and MFA Theatre Directing students, leading to an internal performance in one of our studios.

  

##### Term 2

###### Contemporary Text

In this module, each group works with a director to devise an entirely new show in response to a text, novel or article. These studio-scale shows are performed to an invited public audience at the School.

###### Shakespeare and The Shakespeare's Globe Residency

This module starts with three weeks of workshops and masterclasses designed to deepen your understanding of Shakespeare's text: its meaning and mechanics. You'll explore analytical and experimental approaches to develop clarity and accuracy while inhabiting the text truthfully. You'll also take part in masterclasses delivered by professionals with extensive experience at the RSC, National Theatre and Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.

The second half of this module is a three-week residency at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. During this time, you'll work with the Globe's own directors and experts in text, movement, voice and dance, rehearsing and performing 50-minute versions of Shakespearean texts on the Globe stage for an invited public audience.

  

##### Term 3

###### Acting for Camera and Microphone

You'll participate in Acting for Camera workshops, followed by filming Showreels and recording Voicereels for your own portfolio, as well as the *Online MA Acting (International) Showcase*.

###### Writing Workshops

These writing workshops with a professional playwright are aimed at developing self-penned solo theatre projects.

###### Online Showcase

*The MA Acting (International) Online Showcase* is launched to our wide database of UK Industry contacts, as well as selected Industry contacts abroad. The showcase also promotes your final public performances to UK Industry.

###### Public Production

You'll perform in one of three full-length plays in our [Corbett Theatre](http://www.east15.ac.uk/loughton) at East 15. These productions are directed by established professional directors and fully supported by professional set, costume, lighting and sound designers. This experience allows you to create at least one complete role in a public production promoted to Industry, showcasing your talent and skills as a graduating MA Acting (International) student. MFA Acting (International) first-year students take on supporting roles in these productions.

###### Solo Theatre Writing and Public Performance

Your second public performance is the MA International Voices show, featuring a compendium of self-penned solo pieces, performed in our Corbett Theatre. This show is promoted to industry professionals, in addition to being livestreamed world over.

###### Professional Preparation

You'll participate in Professional Practice sessions with industry professionals, which include self-tape workshops led by casting directors, as well as workshops on Self-Promotion, Branding, Marketing, and starting your own company.

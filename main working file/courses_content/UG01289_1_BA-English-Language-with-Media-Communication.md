Does language in the media affect people's opinions and actions? How is language used in social and traditional media for politics, art, and business communication? What does the language used in the media tell us about English-speaking societies?

This course explores the structure and use of the English language as well as how Media is used to communicate, from the perspectives of both businesses and politicians and also in every day society.

During your studies you explore topics such as:

* Propaganda in film and literature* How language is used in conversation* How the pronunciation of speech varies* The role of new media in shaping mass culture* How questioning in broadcast interviews has changed over time* How politicians use rhetorical devices to generate applause from audiences* How the media is used for marketing purposes* How people use language on social media to construct identities for themselves

### Study abroad

Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.

Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.

If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university.

### Placement year

On a placement year you gain relevant work experience within an external business, giving you a competitive edge in the graduate job market and providing you with key contacts within the industry.

If you complete a placement year you'll only pay 20% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year.

### Our expert staff

[Our staff](https://www.essex.ac.uk/%E2%80%9Dhttps:/www.essex.ac.uk/departments/language-and-linguistics/people/academic%E2%80%9D) maintain excellent student-staff ratios with capped language-specific seminars.

In theoretical linguistics, Kyle Jerro and Hannah Gibson work on the structure of words and sentences, focusing on English and other languages. Scott Lewis and Nancy Kula work on sound structure.

In sociolinguistics, Rebecca Clift, Enam Al Wer, Ella Jeffries and Amanda Cole all work on different aspects of how language varies, and investigate which factors cause such variation.

In applied linguistics, Karen Roehr-Brackin and Adela Gánem-Gutiérrez focus on the learning of second and further languages, whilst Tracey Costley, Christina Gkonou, Neophytos Mitsigkas and Nasser Jabbari focus on issues to do with the classroom teaching of English as a foreign language.

In psycholinguistics, Claire Delle Luche and Laurie Lawyer use experimental techniques such as eyetracking and EEG to understand how children learn language, how adults process language, and what happens when language ability is impaired by brain disorders or other factors (e.g. hearing impairment).

In all of these areas, we combine a theoretical approach with high-level, qualitative and quantitative, empirical and experimental technique; in particular, we have a strong interest in recent developments in inferential statistics.

### Specialist facilities

The study of linguistics provides the opportunity for plenty of hands-on experience as well as theoretical work. You might be?listening to interviews, studying language processing, or analysing sounds, so we provide extensive facilities to allow you to fully engage with a wide variety of linguistic methods:

* Our Eye-Tracking Lab has equipment for monitoring response times and eye movements when individuals are presented with pictures and videos* Our Psycholinguistics Lab has computing facilities for measuring how long it takes individuals to react to words, texts and sounds* Our Linguistics Lab, where we run behavioural experiments* Our EEG Lab is used for recording brain activity during reading, listening, or watching video of language materials* Meet other language enthusiasts through our student-run Linguistics Society
          Within our department, we also offer:* An exciting programme of research seminars and other events* Our Albert Sloman Library houses a strong collection of books, journals, electronic resources and major archives* Our Languages for All programme offers you the opportunity to study an additional language alongside your course at no extra cost* Meet other language enthusiasts through our student-run Linguistics Society

### Your future

An English Language degree opens the door to a career in a variety of areas, including education, IT, HR, and writing. The media aspect of this course will specifically prepare you for a career in the media industry. By combining these two subject areas you add an edge to your CV and ensure you gain knowledge and experience in both areas simultaneously.

We also work with the University's [Student Development Team](http://www.essex.ac.uk/careers) to help you find out about further work experience, internships, placements, and voluntary opportunities.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

Sociolinguistics

(15 CREDITS)

The aim of this module is to examine language variation according to social, contextual and linguistic factors.

### Placement

Alternatively, you can spend your third year on a [placement year](http://www.essex.ac.uk/careers/placements/default.aspx) with an external organisation, where you learn about a particular sector, company or job role, apply your academic knowledge in a practical working environment, and receive inspiration for future career pathways. You will be responsible for finding your placement, but with support and guidance provided by both your department and our Employability and Careers Centre.

If you complete a placement year you'll only pay 20% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year.

### Year abroad

On your year abroad, you have the opportunity to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised. The rest of your course remains identical to the three-year degree.

Undergraduate students studying Modern Languages modules would typically involve two to three hours of classes per week (but note that the intensive language modules would involve four to five hours of classes per week). Classes usually contain up to 20 students within each group.

* Teaching is arranged to allow freedom in how you organise your learning experience* Examples of practical work include digitally recording dialect speakers in a small traditional fishing community, or scouring digitised child language databanks* Other teaching methods include lectures, demonstrations and learning by teaching others

### Assessment

* You're assessed through a combination of coursework (assignments, essays and tests) and end-of-year examinations.* Weighted 50% coursework and 50% exams depending on which modules you choose.* Other assessment methods include quizzes, presentations, portfolios, group work, and projects.

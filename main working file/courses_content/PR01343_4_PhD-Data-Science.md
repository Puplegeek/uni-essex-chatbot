## Overview

The details

Course: 
Data Science

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
4 - 5 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science)

An Integrated PhD provides a route into research study if you do not have a Masters degree, or have very little research training. It enables you to spend your first year completing a Masters-level qualification, followed by a full-time PhD studied over three to four years. We also offer a [‘standard' PhD](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pr01343/1/phd-data-science) in this subject which can be studied either full-time (three to four years) or part-time (six to seven years).

The techniques we use to model and manipulate data guide the political, financial and social decisions that shape our modern society and are the basis of growth of the economy and success of businesses. Technology is growing and evolving at an incredible speed, and both the rate of growth of data we generate and the devices we use to process it can only increase.

Data science is a growing and important field of study with a fast-growing number of jobs and opportunities within the private and public sector. The application of theory and methods to real-world problems and applications is at the core of data science, which aims especially to use and to exploit big data.

If you are interested in solving real-world problems, you like to develop skills to use smart devices efficiently, you want to use and to foster your understanding of mathematics, and you are interested and keen to use statistical techniques and methods to interpret data, then the first year of our Integrated PhD Data Science may be for you.

In your second year you move onto the PhD element of the course. We have staff members available to act as supervisors across a number of areas within data science, such as:

* artificial intelligence* classification/supervised learning* clustering/unsupervised learning* data science education* deep learning* industry 4.0* information retrieval* mathematical foundations of data science* multidimensional scaling* optimisation* statistical learning

The University of Essex is a leading institution worldwide on Data Science Education. Our [School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science) has a strong track record on Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTP) with data-driven industries, including: Profusion, Mondaq, MSXI and Ocado.

> “The journey of a PhD student is just like a roller coaster, so make sure you take the time to celebrate the wins and reflect on the losses. My PhD involves examining the process of skeletal muscle activation/deactivation by developing novel mathematical methods to extract dynamic information from image data. The most enjoyable aspect of my work is the flexibility it gives me as an individual and being able to deepen my understanding in the field of Bayesian statistics, which I find particularly interesting. In the future I plan to work in the industry as a Data Scientist, on various projects related either to macroeconomics or finance.”

### English language requirements

If English is not your first language , we require IELTS 6.0, or equivalent with a minimum of 5.5 in all other components.

## Structure

### Course structure

Most of our taught courses combine compulsory and optional modules, giving you freedom to pursue your own interests. All of the modules listed below provide an example of what is on offer from the current academic year. Our Programme Specification provides further details of the course structure for the current academic year.

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.

The research element of your degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

(30 CREDITS)

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY

Applied Regression and Experimental Data Analysis

(15 CREDITS)

This module is concerned with the application of regression models to the analysis of data. The underlying assumptions will be discussed and general results are obtained using matrices. You will be introduced to the standard approach to the analysis of normally distributed data using ANOVA, as well as the methods for the design and analysis of efficient experiments. The general methodology is extended to nonlinear regression, generalised regression and the analysis of multidimensional contingency tables.

[View Applied Regression and Experimental Data Analysis on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=MA717&year=25)

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY

Applied Statistics

(15 CREDITS)

In this module, you will study three application areas of statistics - multivariate methods, demography and epidemiology, and sampling, and how to apply and assess these methods in a variety of situations.

[View Applied Statistics on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=MA321&year=25)

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY

Machine Learning

(15 CREDITS)

Humans can often perform a task extremely well (e.g., telling cats from dogs) but are unable to understand and describe the decision process followed. Without this explicit knowledge, we cannot write computer programs that can be used by machines to perform the same task. “Machine learning” is the study and application of methods to learn such algorithms automatically from sets of examples, just like babies can learn to tell cats from dogs simply by being shown examples of dogs and cats by their parents. Machine learning has proven particularly suited to cases such as optical character recognition, dictation software, language translators, fraud detection in financial transactions, and many others.

[View Machine Learning on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=CE802&year=25)

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY

Data Visualisation

(15 CREDITS)

In a world increasingly driven by data, the need for analysis and visualisation is more important than ever. In this module you will look at data through the eyes of a numerical detective. You will work on the lost art of exploratory data analysis, reviewing appropriate methods for data summaries with the aim to summarise, understand, extract hidden patterns and identify relationships. You will then work on graphical data analysis, using simple graphs to understand the data, but also advanced complex methods to scrutinise data and interactive plots to communicate data information to a wider audience.
For data analysis and visualisations you will use R-studio, and a combination of R-shiny applications and google visualisations for interactive plotting.

[View Data Visualisation on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=MA304&year=25)

COMPONENT 07: COMPULSORY

Research Skills and Employability

(0 CREDITS)

What skills do you need to succeed during your studies? What about after university? How will you harness your knowledge and soft skills to realise your career goals? This module helps you take an active role in developing transferrable skills and capitalising on your unique background. As well as broad reflection on your professional development, this module will help you explore different career directions and prepare you for the application process, supported by an advisor from within the department.

[View Research Skills and Employability on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=MA199&year=25)

COMPONENT 08: CORE WITH OPTIONS

[MA981-7-SL or MA983-7-SL](https://www.essex.ac.uk/component/?componentID=6378cd81-2e8d-4139-815d-d8f8cb87eb55&headerImg=/-/media/header-images/data-analytics/data-analytics_ptait_20191107_0772-%281%29--autorenamed.jpg&lastYear=1&title=PhD%20Data%20Science)

(60 CREDITS)

### Teaching

* Core components can be combined with optional modules, to enable you to gain either in-depth specialisation or broad understanding.* Learn to use LATEX to produce a document as close as possible to what professional mathematicians produce in terms of organisation, layout and type-setting.* Our postgraduates are encouraged to attend conferences and seminars.

### Assessment

* Our taught modules are assessed on the results of your written examinations, together with continual assessments of your practical work and coursework.

### Dissertation

A PhD (taking at least three years) typically involves wide reading around the subject area in your first year, then gradually developing original results over your second and third years, before writing them up in a coherent fashion. The resulting thesis is expected to make a significant contribution to knowledge.

Your PhD is awarded after your successful defence of your thesis in an oral examination (viva), in which you are interviewed about your research by two examiners, at least one of whom is from outside Essex.

## Fees and funding

### Home/UK fee

£5,006 per year

### International fee

£19,650 per year

Fees will increase for each academic year of study.

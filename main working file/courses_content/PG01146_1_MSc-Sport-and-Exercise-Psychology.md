Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 05: CORE

Participation and Wellbeing

(15 CREDITS)

This module explores contemporary topics in exercise and health psychology, focusing on translational research evidence. Physical activity and exercise are increasingly used to improve the health and wellbeing of the general population. You will gain an understanding of up-to-date research evidence on topics including motivation, self-concept, mental health, social support and the environment. You will explore how research is translated into applied interventions and how these interventions are evaluated.

[View Participation and Wellbeing on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=SE734&year=25)

COMPONENT 06: CORE

Developmental Sport and Exercise Psychology

(15 CREDITS)

In this module, students will compare physiological responses to exercise of children and adolescents, with those of adults, examining the effects of age, sex and maturation. Students will examine the role that physical activity and fitness can play in improving markers of health and wellbeing in young people; an increasingly important area of study due to recent evidence (from work at the University of Essex showing declines in children's fitness). This module will explain the immediate and possible future benefits of physical activity and exercise for the health and wellbeing of healthy children and young athletes.

COMPONENT 07: CORE

Social psychology in sport and exercise

(15 CREDITS)

The module examines approaches to support learning both in and through sport. As part of the module, students develop their understanding of the learning needs of a range of participants and the pedagogical understanding coaches require in order to effectively meet their participant’s needs. Further, students will work in small groups to examine the influence of context, internal and external assets in sport and how each can be utilised in order to develop and transfer broader psychosocial skills beyond sport. The module also discusses approaches to the design, delivery and evaluation of such programmes, which is an essential skill for coaches and teachers more broadly. Students will also demonstrate self-directed and informal learning by delivering coaching workshops, discussing good practice, and creating coaching resources with peers beyond their immediate year group.

COMPONENT 08: CORE

Skill Acquisition and Expertise in Sport

(15 CREDITS)

Skill acquisition is commonly described as the voluntary control over movements in an attempt to solve motor skill problems and achieve a task goal. These may vary from catching a ball or riding a bike, to slalom skiing or rhythmic gymnastics. Regardless of the domain, the interaction between the practitioner (eg coach or PE teacher) and athlete when learning these skills is absolutely fundamental to successful performance. Specifically, how can the practitioner create optimal practice conditions to facilitate skill acquisition? This module will firstly enhance your understanding of contemporary theory and research in skill learning and motor expertise. From this, the module takes on a more applied focus, where evidence-based approaches are implemented to critically evaluate their effect on coaching practice.

[View Skill Acquisition and Expertise in Sport on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=SE762&year=25)

Physiotherapy is a science-based health care profession committed to extending, applying, evaluating and reviewing the evidence that underpins and informs its practice. Physiotherapists adopt a ‘whole person' approach to maximise the potential of a person's function and movement. Thus, physiotherapists not only help people stay independent for as long possible after illness or injury, but also help maintain health for people of all ages, preventing disease and managing pain.

Patient involvement is at the core of this approach and as such, key attributes a physiotherapist must possess include the ability to empower, relate and educate people to facilitate change in their health and wellbeing. Physiotherapists are autonomous professionals, able to act as first-contact practitioners, as well as accepting referrals from other health care professionals. Consequently, central to physiotherapy practice is clinical judgement and informed interpretation of clinical information.

Physiotherapists are also professionals who work in increasingly complex environments. We produce graduates who demonstrate effective problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, underpinned by a sound physiotherapy knowledge base and appropriate professional skills. To succeed, you will possess self-directed learning habits that enable you to continue as a reflective practitioner and lifelong learner, maintaining your fitness to practise throughout your career.

Our full-time BSc Physiotherapy course is studied over three years and is designed as a continuous progression of integrated theory and practice, emphasising students being proactive partners in their learning experiences.

Our [School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences) (SRES) is a community specifically focused on sports and exercise science, sports therapy and physiotherapy. We are based in the Essex Sport Arena at the Colchester Campus and bring together internationally-recognised research, knowledge and placement and vocational opportunities for our students and graduates.

#### Vaccinations

We continue to recommend COVID-19 and flu vaccinations. This is to protect you and the vulnerable people you may meet throughout your placement.

#### Practice-based learning opportunities

Practice-based placements are organised by our placement team and each student is timetabled to complete approximately 1,000 hours of practice-based learning. During placements, you'll work with qualified physiotherapists and other professionals to consolidate your learning, gain new experiences, and develop and refine your abilities. Learning on placement is achieved through interactive experiences and practice educators facilitating personal and professional growth within a variety of settings. The environment is supportive, enabling you to rehearse skills with constructive feedback.

To maximise the learning opportunities available to you, we work with a variety of practice-based learning providers across our region. From our Colchester Campus you may need to travel up to 90 minutes each day to and from a placement location, or use local accommodation for locations that are further afield. Eligible students are able to claim back these additional costs associated with attending placements through the [NHS business authority](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-learning-support-fund-lsf), who you can also apply to for a grant of £5,000 per academic year (that you won't need to pay back!). Additional funding may also be available depending on your personal circumstances. You can find more information about eligibility and how to apply on the [Health and Social Care Scholarships and Funding page](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care/scholarships-and-funding).

You will be provided with two student physiotherapist uniform polo shirts, as well as two tunics and two pairs of trousers, prior to your first practice placement (you can also purchase additional items, if you choose).

#### Additional expenses

You will incur additional costs and expenses throughout this course, which you can learn more about in our [Additional Course-Related Expenses document](https://www.essex.ac.uk/-/media/documents/departments/sres/Physiotherapy-additional-course-related-expenses-2025-26.docx) (.doc).

### Our expert staff

Our physiotherapy courses are taught by a friendly team of [registered, experienced staff](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences/people) with a variety of different backgrounds. We have expertise across the areas of acute inpatient care, community settings, and outpatient rehabilitation, as well as in research and professional leadership.

Our physiotherapy team also invites practising clinicians to contribute to the teaching on this course.

The BSc Physiotherapy course lead is [Debbie Miles](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/MILES33008), who qualified as a physiotherapist in 2006 having completed a pre-registration Masters programme at Teesside University. Debbie went on to work for more than 10 years in the NHS, in London and then Kent, specialising in the management of hand and wrist injuries and conditions whilst also developing a keen interest in clinical education. Having previously worked part-time at the University of Essex alongside an ongoing clinical role, Debbie moved full-time into education in 2018, though she continues some clinical practice alongside this.

### Specialist facilities

* We have a range of [specialist clinical laboratories](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences/facilities) and IT facilities to assist you with the effective learning and acquisition of new skills. For students of BSc Physiotherapy, we have four specialist labs with all you need to train as a physiotherapist.* We offer excellent physical and online resources in terms of libraries, computer labs, datasets, archives and other research materials.* You can take advantage of our links with the Institute of Social and Economic Research, which conducts large-scale survey projects, many for government, EU and other public agencies, and has its own library.* The UK Data Archive is also based at our Colchester Campus and stores national research data.

### Your future

Successful completion of our BSc Physiotherapy leads to eligibility to apply for registration as a physiotherapist with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), which allows you to practise as a physiotherapist in the UK and to join the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) as a full member.

We also work with our University's [Student Development Team](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/careers/) to help you find out about further work experience, internships, placements, and voluntary opportunities.

#### Sport scholarships

Our [Performance Sport Scholarship](https://www.essex.ac.uk/scholarships/sports-scholarships-and-bursaries) programme has been created for talented athletes playing at regional, national or international level, and offers a range of benefits. We want students competing in our focus sports - basketball, volleyball, tennis and football - as well as other team sports and as individual athletes to contribute to our performance sport programme.

These benefits are designed to help athletes focus on their training and development, and to enable you to reach your full potential alongside your studies.

> “My last placement at a Cardiothoracics ITU in Essex was an incredible experience. I learnt so much and it was so interesting I can’t tell you how much! The team were the best I’ve ever been with, and any other students are so lucky to be placed there, it was hands down the best placement I’ve had. I felt sad to leave.”

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

There will also be a focus on autonomy in practice, demonstration of ability, and willingness to continue your professional development after qualification.

You can find further information on how to apply, including information on transferring from another university, applying if you are not currently at a school or college, and applying for readmission on our [How to apply and entry requirements](https://www.essex.ac.uk/undergraduate/applying-to-essex) page.

### Interview

Undergraduate students who apply for our health-related courses are required to pass a compulsory interview before an offer can be made. If you are shortlisted for interview based on your application, you will be invited to interview with us via Microsoft Teams. We use the interview as an opportunity to get to know you, to find out about your ambitions, and assess how prepared you are for the course. It's important for us to be sure that you know what you're signing up for, so we'd expect you've done some research about the course and the associated careers it may lead to. We have some more information about how to demonstrate you have what it takes at the bottom of our  [undergraduate page](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care/undergraduate#application)

### How can I demonstrate I have what it takes?

Our physiotherapy courses are underpinned by the NHS Constitution, as well as our own Essex values. The NHS Constitution is an important document which establishes the principles and values of the NHS in England.

This document very clearly explains that the patient is at the heart of everything the NHS does. We take this commitment seriously, and so are looking for people who have the potential to be future healthcare superstars. You may wish to consider this in your written application.

Our courses are a blend of both theory and practice, so we also need to hear from you about both your academic and practical skills. Think carefully about how your experiences have prepared you for some of the challenges of the course, and how they can make you stand out from the crowd. For example, if you've worked in retail, you're likely to have developed your communication skills, so you may be able to talk about this.

### What can I do to prepare for my interview?

For many people, the idea of being interviewed is quite daunting. There's no need to panic. We're on your side. We aim to use the interview process to get to know you and to find out your plans for the future.

Our interview panels are made up from current staff and students, service users/experts by experience, and local placement partners. Many of the panel will have been through a similar process at some point in their career, so they'll appreciate you'll probably be feeling nervous. Try to relax (as best as you can) and think of it more as a discussion with colleagues about why you'd like to join us.

### Offer Holder Days

If you're successful at interview, you will receive an email invitation to book onto one of our Offer Holder Days after your offer is made. Our Physiotherapy Offer Holder Days are on Saturday 17 February 2024, Saturday 9 March 2024, Wednesday 4 April 2024 and Saturday 4 May 2024. Offer Holder Days provide the opportunity to meet your department, tour our campus and accommodation, and chat to current students. We appreciate that travelling to university events can be expensive, so we are offering an Offer Holder Day Travel Bursary, allowing you to claim up to £150 as reimbursement for travel expenses. For further information about Offer Holder Days, including terms and conditions and eligibility criteria for our Travel Bursary, please visit our [Offer Holder Days](https://www.essex.ac.uk/visit-us/offer-holder-days) webpage.

If you are an overseas offer-holder, you will be invited to attend one of our virtual events. However, you are more than welcome to join us at one of our in-person Offer Holder Days if you are able to - we will let you know in your invite email how you can do this.

## Overview

The details

Course: 
Mathematics

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
9 months

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science)

Postgraduate Diplomas last for six to nine months (full-time) and include the modules and assessed work of a Masters, without a dissertation.

Mathematics is the language that underpins the rest of science. Our interdisciplinary research recognises that mathematics, including what can be very abstract mathematics, is an essential part of research in many other disciplines. Our Postgraduate Diploma Mathematics provides an exceptional range of knowledge and skills that are currently in demand in mathematically oriented employment: in business, commerce, industry, government service, education, and in the wider economy.

Topics on offer include:

* pure mathematics, including algebra, graph theory, number theory and cryptography* applied topics such as mathematical modelling, numerical methods, dynamical systems and differential equations* statistical and financial methods including stochastic processes, financial derivatives and computational statistics

As well as these mathematical topics, this degree develops your programming skills in languages such as Python and SQL, and you learn to solve sophisticated problems using computational toolkits such as MATLAB, Maple, and R.

Our [School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science) has an international reputation in many areas including semi-group theory, optimisation, probability, applied statistics, bioinformatics, mathematical biology, dynamical systems, complex systems, and complex networks. we are genuinely innovative and student-focused. Our research groups are working on a broad range of collaborative areas tackling real-world issues.

* Our data scientists carefully consider how not to lie, and how not to get lied to with data. Interpreting data correctly is especially important because much of our data science research is applied directly or indirectly to social policies, including health, care and education.* We do practical research with financial data (for example, assessing the risk of collapse of the UK's banking system) as well as theoretical research in financial instruments such as insurance policies or asset portfolios.* We also research how physical processes develop in time and space. Applications of this range from modelling epilepsy to modelling electronic cables.* Our optimisation experts work out how to do the same job with less resource, or how to do more with the same resource.* Our pure maths group are currently working on two new funded projects entitled ‘Machine learning for recognising tangled 3D objects' and ‘Searching for gems in the landscape of cyclically presented groups'.* Our applied mathematicians apply mathematical methods to a diverse range of fields, including finance, epidemiology, biology (both animal and human), dynamical systems, chaos theory, Hamiltonian systems, neuroscience, physics and tensor product decompositions.* We also do research into mathematical education and use exciting technologies such as electroencephalography or eye tracking to measure exactly what a learner is feeling. Our research aims to encourage the implementation of ‘the four Cs' of modern education, which are critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity.

Why we're great.

* We are the 'ideas people' of the maths world - work with award-winning teachers and researchers.
* Through our pioneering teaching approach we develop the mathematicians of the future.
* Our students run a renowned Maths Support Centre which offers advice to other departments at Essex and far beyond – we have calls from as far afield as China.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

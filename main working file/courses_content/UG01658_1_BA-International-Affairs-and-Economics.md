Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: CORE

Portfolio: Politics

(30 CREDITS)

This module gives students an opportunity to apply politics and international relations to address key issues facing society at the local, national and global level. For example, why do mass protests fail? What is next for women's rights in Afghanistan? Why are some civil wars so difficult to resolve? What effect will Covid-19 have on European welfare states? Is increasing political polarisation inevitable in an age of social media?
This module will engage with different topics and themes to better understand how normative and positive approaches to political science and international relations can be used to comprehend issues in the contemporary world. Students will choose a topic of interest to them, conduct independent research on the topic, and produce a series of projects (a blogpost, a podcast, and a policy memo) that help them explore multifaceted ways of communicating what evidence-based research can tell society about different political events and outcomes around the world.

[View Portfolio: Politics on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=GV840&year=25)

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY

International Current Affairs: Understanding our World

(15 CREDITS)

International Current Affairs (or Understanding Our World) aims to introduce you to cutting edge debates in international politics and media in the age of misinformation and post-truth. The module aims to prepare Essex students to be new generation of solution-focused graduates with a sophisticated understanding of the complexities of our interconnected world. Beyond the focus on the global North that usually dominate our understanding of international politics, the module will also provide insight into major events and crises in the global South, while reflecting on policies, how they are developed and their impact on the everyday life of citizens around the world.

[View International Current Affairs: Understanding our World on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=GV926&year=25)

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY

International Financial Institutions and Policy

(15 CREDITS)

Understand the institutional framework within which international financial relations are organised.

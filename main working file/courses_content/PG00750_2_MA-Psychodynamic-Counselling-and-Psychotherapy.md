## Overview

The details

Course: 
Psychodynamic Counselling and Psychotherapy (3 year)

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Part-time

Duration: 
3 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychosocial-and-psychoanalytic-studies)

Do you want to train as a psychodynamic counsellor? Would you like to learn how to work therapeutically in depth with either adults or children/adolescents?

This course offers a professional qualification to work as a counsellor. You gain thorough theoretical and practical training, including a supervised placement, enabling you to qualify and practise as a member of the British Association of Psychotherapy and Counselling.

This course provides a route to a counselling career for graduates from psychology, sociology or many other related degrees as well as for established professionals, such as teachers, social workers, nurses and care workers.

In the first year you learn about psychodynamic theory and its applications and develop the skills you will need in practice. In the second year, you take up a placement as trainee counsellor to develop your proficiency and confidence as a practitioner. You will be placed in an agency such as a school, counselling organisation or other support service. A requirement of this course is that you are in personal therapy or counselling on a weekly basis and you will need weekly supervision.

If you are an EU or EEA national, you will only be able to study a part-time course if you hold settled status in the UK. If you are a non-EEA, and non-UK national, you will only be able to study a part-time course if you hold a UK immigration permission which allows part-time study. If you will need a student visa to study in the UK then you will not be able to study part-time.

### Professional accreditation

Accredited by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).

Why we're great.

* A clinical training programme for professionals working either with adults or children and adolescents
* Gain practical experience through placements in schools or local agencies
* Acquire a professional qualification to work therapeutically with adults or children and adolescents

### Our expert staff

Our [Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies](http://www.essex.ac.uk/cps/) is internationally recognised as one of the leading departments for work that focuses on the role of the unconscious mind in mental health, as well as in culture and society generally. Our research and teaching is deeply grounded in knowledge deriving from clinical practice, to which our highest standards of academic thinking are then applied.

Being located within a leading university for the study of social sciences means you are surrounded by strong departments that fully support and enhance our work. This allows you to gain the opportunity to work with and be taught by senior clinicians and world-class scholars in their fields.

### Specialist facilities

If you are studying within our Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies, you will have access to our extensive facilities to aid your learning and research. In particular, our Albert Sloman Library is well stocked with books, journals, electronic resources and major archives relevant to our work and, in addition, we have our own library of specialist books and journals.

We hold free evening Open Seminars on topics relevant to psychoanalysis which are open to students, staff and members of the public.

### Your future

Graduates from our Graduate Diploma Psychodynamic Counselling and Psychotherapy who do not continue in the training may well already be professionals, clinical and non-clinical, and will return to their existing fields, either in jobs or further training, and use their learning from the course to deepen their understanding of their work.

Graduates from our MA Psychodynamic Counselling and Psychotherapy are qualified counsellors who take up positions in many agencies providing counselling to young people. Graduates from our department go on to a number of different destinations, including further study and training in psychoanalysis, Jungian analysis, or psychoanalytic psychotherapy.

Recent MA Psychodynamic Counselling and Psychotherapy graduate, Kate Beckwith, has set up her own private practice. She is the founder of Elle's Garden, an outdoor, nature-based therapeutic practice for infants, children and young people, which also incorporates parent and family work. Based just outside Colchester, it is a therapeutic practice with a difference – and the only one of its kind in the country. Located in a private setting in natural woodland, the approach utilises the outdoors, nature, animals, art, and play. Read more about [Kate's Essex experience](https://www.essex.ac.uk/news/2023/03/30/spring-graduates-2023-kate-beckwith) and how it has enriched her career.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

### Offer Holder Days

If you receive an undergraduate offer to study with us in October 2026 and live in the UK, you will receive an email invitation to book onto one of our Offer Holder Days. Our Colchester Campus Offer Holder Days run in Spring 2026 on various Wednesdays and Saturdays, and our Southend Campus event will also run in Spring 2026. These events provide the opportunity to meet your department, tour our campus and accommodation, and chat to current students. Please visit our [Offer Holder Days webpage](https://www.essex.ac.uk/visit-us/offer-holder-days) for more information, including terms and conditions.

If you are an overseas offer-holder, you are more than welcome to join us at one of our in-person Offer Holder Days if you are able to - we will let you know in your invite email how you can do this. If you can't make it, we will provide plenty of opportunities to get a feel for life at Essex, virtually.

## Overview

The details

Course: 
Psychoanalytic Studies

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychosocial-and-psychoanalytic-studies)

How has the notion of 'Freudian unconscious' shaped Western culture and been transmitted around the world? How does the unconscious affect us individually and socially? How can an individual and their culture be viewed from a psychoanalytic perspective? Our MA Psychoanalytic Studies will give you a unique and fascinating way of exploring how the unconscious affects both individuals and societies and cultures.

If you cannot see this video, you can [watch it on our Vimeo channel](http://vimeo.com/236887650) within your browser.

Our course provides you with a thorough grounding in psychoanalytic theory through which to explore its application both to the clinical setting and to culture and society. Starting with the cultural milieu from which psychoanalysis emerged, you begin with Freud and follow on through the development of object relations, focusing on the ‘British School', including theorists such as Klein, Winnicott, Bion and others.

By encouraging your critical attitude, we foster an engagement with psychoanalysis - both historically and comparatively - always keeping in mind its methodological link to the clinical experiences from which psychoanalysis itself was developed. Whether you work in the mental health field or have an interest in the application of psychoanalysis to groups, to literature, or to wider social and cultural issues, our programme offers a fantastic and lively opportunity for personal, academic and professional development.

Topics covered in the course include:

* Reading Freud* Psychoanalytic theory* Psychoanalysis in contexts* Psychoanalysis and the Psychosocial* Psychoanalytic Epistemology* The Psychic Life of Gender* Clinical and Critical: Contemporary Debates in Psychoanalytic Theory

Why we're great.

* Work with world-leading scholars as well as highly experienced practitioners
* Close links with health, education and social care services ensures our courses are highly credible
* We take an interdisciplinary approach with links to sociology, philosophy, literature and business

### Our expert staff

Our [Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychosocial-and-psychoanalytic-studies) is internationally recognised as one of the leading departments for work that focuses on the role of the unconscious mind in mental health, as well as in culture and society generally. Our research and teaching is deeply grounded in knowledge deriving from clinical practice, to which our highest standards of academic thinking are then applied.

Being located within the UK's leading university of the study of social sciences means you are surrounded by strong departments that fully support and enhance our work. This allows you to gain the opportunity to work with and be taught by senior clinicians and world-class scholars in their fields.

### Specialist facilities

If you are studying within our Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies, you will have access to our extensive facilities to aid your learning and research. In particular, our Albert Sloman Library is well stocked with books, journals, electronic resources and major archives relevant to our work and, in addition, we have our own library of specialist books and journals.

We hold free evening Open Seminars on topics relevant to psychoanalysis which are open to students, staff and members of the public.

### Your future

You will develop key employability skills including thinking analytically, evaluation, essay-writing, research methods in psychoanalysis and an understanding of psychoanalytic thinking, applicable to clinical and academic work. Our course could lead you to study for a PhD in psychoanalytic studies or to work in a clinical or non-clinical setting.

Our graduates go on to a number of different destinations, including further study and training in psychoanalysis, Jungian analysis, or psychoanalytic psychotherapy.

Many of our students are already professionals, clinical and non-clinical, so return to their existing fields, either in jobs or further training, and use study with us to deepen their understanding of their work.

> “A year went by so quickly, but I still enjoyed my time at Essex a lot. I am currently working for a large corporation, with the aim of getting into human resources. A module in the course developed my interest in how people relate within working environments, how groups choose leaders, and how to increase productivity. I learnt a lot from my excellent lecturers."

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: CORE

Research Methods and Dissertation

(60 CREDITS)

What interests you? Do you want to deepen your knowledge, build invaluable research skills and develop your academic freedom? Your dissertation lets you study a topic of your choosing, in depth, with supervision and guidance from our world-leading academics.

[View Research Methods and Dissertation on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA981&year=25)

COMPONENT 02: CORE

Reading Freud

(15 CREDITS)

Much of the clinical and theoretical work you will study in the MA derives from, reworks, or reacts to Freud’s writing. This module is designed to introduce you to Freud’s thinking, looking at a variety of his texts; some classics you may have encountered before, and some that are likely to be new to you. Topics will include the theory of dreams; infantile sexuality; Freud's first and second 'topography of psychical systems; narcissism and the internalisation of the object in mourning.

[View Reading Freud on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA941&year=25)

COMPONENT 03: CORE

Psychoanalytic Theory

(30 CREDITS)

In this module we will explore the main theoretical developments since Freud, with emphasis on the British school. Amongst the authors studied you will find: Sandor Ferenczi, Anna Freud, Melanie Klein, Wilfred Bion, Donald Winnicott, John Bowlby, Michael Balint, Jacques Lacan, and Heinz Kohut. The aim of the module is to understand the developments while comparing different analytic and psychoanalytic schools.

[View Psychoanalytic Theory on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA901&year=25)

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY

Clinical and Critical: Contemporary Dialogues in Psychoanalytic Theory

(15 CREDITS)

The module provides an exploration of contemporary issues and debates in psychoanalytic theory, focusing on some of the main post-Freudian clinical revisions that constitute the psychoanalytic imaginary of our times, but also on the development of a critical take on psychoanalytic theory. While the clinical context is the main site of observation, the module is also committed to take psychoanalysis outside the clinic and to allow it to illuminate societal processes that mobilise our critical reflection.

[View Clinical and Critical: Contemporary Dialogues in Psychoanalytic Theory on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA935&year=25)

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY

The Psychic Life of Gender

(15 CREDITS)

This module introduces students to some of the ways in which psychoanalytic thought has animated different feminist, trans, and queer accounts of gender since Freud’s time of writing. We will avoid a polarised presentation of psychoanalysis as either friend or foe to progressive accounts of gender, but rather commit to investigating how psychoanalysis – both as theory and as praxis – can productively disrupt our stable knowledge economies, and lend itself to encounters with gender that feature resistance, interruption, revelation, and impasse.

[View The Psychic Life of Gender on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA936&year=25)

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY

Psychoanalytic Epistemology

(15 CREDITS)

Psychoanalysis is an intrinsically interdisciplinary field. This module aims to debate the nature of our discipline. After an initial analysis of Freud’s methodology for theory construction, we will analyse different arguments and criticisms made by both psychoanalytic and non-psychoanalytic scholars as to what type of discipline psychoanalysis is and what sort of methodologies it should utilise to gather and validate its theories.

[View Psychoanalytic Epistemology on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA928&year=25)

COMPONENT 07: COMPULSORY

Psychoanalysis: Controversies and Contexts

(15 CREDITS)

This module explores intellectual, cultural, social and interdisciplinary contexts of the development of psychoanalysis and its theoretical and clinical ideas. The aim is firstly to provide a better understanding of how certain concepts and issues arose in a particular historical and cultural climate, and secondly to foster a critical approach to the history and theory of psychoanalysis.

[View Psychoanalysis: Controversies and Contexts on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA976&year=25)

COMPONENT 08: COMPULSORY

Psychoanalysis and the Psychosocial

(15 CREDITS)

This module is designed to explore the relationship between psychosocial studies and psychoanalysis. You’ll be introduced to a range of significant psychoanalytic ideas, not only on their own as abstract theory, but also through their use in various fields, clinical and nonclinical. Such an approach will help you understand the utility and limitations of psychoanalytic ideas more deeply and critically.

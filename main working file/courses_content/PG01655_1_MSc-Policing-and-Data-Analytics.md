## Overview

The details

Course: 
Policing and Data Analytics

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Sociology and Criminology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sociology)

Police play a crucial role in society, and policing has a direct impact on the lives, freedoms and security of citizens. Police rely increasingly on evidence and research to design interventions, allocate resources, and evaluate their work. This programme examines key challenges in contemporary policing and provides students with strong quantitative analysis skills to analyse policing. Students will have the opportunity to gain an advanced understanding of how policing works in and tries to adapt to our contemporary world.

Students will address cutting-edge critical, conceptual and theoretical analyses of policing, human rights, privacy and surveillance studies, domestic violence, hate crime, and gender-based violence. They will gain an applied understanding of different research methods and concepts including randomised control trials, the use of ‘R’ and conceptualisations of causality, allowing them to design and critically analyse approaches to gathering evidence. They will have the opportunity to hear from police themselves about how they respond to these challenges. They will be taught by our academic experts who have worked closely with police as well as campaigning for police reform to address brutality, abuse and misconduct. The module equips students with the necessary skills to evaluate the current academic and policy literature on policing and develop a critical understanding of key topics in policing.

* Conceptualising Causality* Randomised Controlled Trials* The use of R* Internal and External Validity* Between- and Within-subjects Designs* Difference in Differences Designs
            ·* Regression Discontinuity Designs* Cybercrime, the dark net, policing the cybersphere* Cop culture through history* AI, big tech, and digital policing* Policing contested crimes: hate, crimes of abuse, and political protest.* Globalisation and crime* Vulnerability, harm and protecting the public* Police in the media and popular culture* International policing and borders* Crime in the city* Police ethics* Gender, race, and crime* Human rights

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

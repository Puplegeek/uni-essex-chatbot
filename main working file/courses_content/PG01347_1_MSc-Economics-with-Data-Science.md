## Overview

The details

Course: 
Economics with Data Science

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Economics](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/economics)

If you‘re looking to study and analyse pressing economic problems using advanced data analytic techniques, the MSc Economics with Data Science is for you. The Department of Economics and the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering have created a joint course that allows you to develop the economic and computational tools to not just isolate problems but also develop sophisticated evidence-based answers.

You'll have the opportunity to learn the essentials of economics, so you can build a grounding to analyse economic problems, you will then build on this knowledge with programming skills. We combine these two approaches in a series of applications that allow you to access and process big data using advanced econometrics and also apply computational techniques to questions of financial economics and macroeconomics.

Our MSc Economics with Data Science allows you to build a theoretical understanding of how to approach economic problems, together with computational skills, with the opportunity of applying these research skills in applications by studying topics such as:

* Computational Models for Microeconomics and Finance* Computational Macroeconomics and Policy Design* Microeconometrics* Applications of Data Analysis

With this course you also have the opportunity to study abroad at one of our partner institutions and achieve a dual award, which means you'll receive two Masters degrees in two years. Find out more on our [dual award webpage.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/masters/dual-awards)

Why we're great.

* 7th in UK for economics (The Guardian University Guide 2025)
* Top 25 in the UK for economics and econometrics in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2024
* 100% of our Economics postgraduate graduates are in employment or further study (Graduate Outcomes 2024)

### Our expert staff

Study and work alongside some of the most prominent social scientists of our time.
Our researchers are at the forefront of their field and have even received MBEs, with students coming from across the globe to study, research or work with us.

Many of our researchers also provide consultancy services to central banks and government agencies, helping us to develop research for today's society as well as informing our teaching for the future.

For a full list of research interests, see our staff pages in [Economics](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/economics/people/academic) and [Computer Science and Electronic Engineering.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering/people)

### Specialist facilities

* Extensive software for quantitative analysis is available in all computer labs across the university* Access a variety of economics databases and multiple copies of textbooks and e-books in the [Albert Sloman Library](https://library.essex.ac.uk/home)* The UK Data Archive and the Institute for Social and Economics Research (ISER) at Essex contribute to our internationally outstanding data science environment

### Your future

After completing your Masters with us, you may wish to extend your knowledge with a research degree – many Essex graduates decide to stay here for further study.

Alternatively, you may choose to initiate your professional career. Our course will prepare you for employment; recent surveys have shown that higher degree graduates are more likely to obtain jobs at professional or managerial level. Our recent Master's level Economics and CSEE graduates have gone on to work for a range of high-profile organisations like The Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund.

## Structure

### Course structure

Our course is structured to combine theory, methods and applications in different departments with special emphasis in research methods. A combination of compulsory and optional modules gives you a flexible structure. Below is just one example structure from the current academic year of a combination of modules you could take. Your course structure could differ based on the modules you choose.

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field, therefore all modules listed are subject to change. View the compulsory modules and full list of optional modules currently on offer, please view the programme specification via the link below.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

## Overview

The details

Course: 
Cancer Biology

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year - 2 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Life Sciences (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/biological-sciences)

Research in our [School of Life Sciences](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences) covers a wide spectrum of biology from genes to ecosystems, and this broad-based structure provides opportunities for developing novel ideas and interdisciplinary projects. We offer supervision in all areas of staff expertise in cancer biology. Our research is at the basic-clinical interface, and we employ a range of techniques for studying cancer at the molecular and cellular level.

We have current projects on:

* the development of stem cell-based therapies* mechanisms of therapy resistance* racial disparities in cancer* translational and clinical proteomics* drug design* genomics and computational biology

Many projects are in collaboration with the NHS and regional hospitals.

As a research student at Essex, you work at the heart of our internationally acknowledged, well-resourced and well-connected research community. We offer world-class supervision and training opportunities, and encourage you to engage with other researchers, professionals, practitioners, and research users, where possible - such as using the generous funding from [Proficio](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/proficio) to attend conferences and training courses.

We also offer an MSD in this area. Both part-time and full-time research study are available. You can start this degree in October, January or April.

Why we're great.

* We have an international reputation for outstanding teaching and research, with the latter reflected in the large number of publications in high-profile journals.
* We are engaged in translational research and have strong links with local and regional hospitals as well as Public Health England.
* Collaborate alongside our research groups working on important international and national problems using cutting-edge techniques.

### Our expert staff

You will be allocated a [supervisor](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences/people) who will guide you through the different stages of your research degree. In some cases, you may have joint supervision by two members of our staff.

The support provided by your supervisor is a key feature of your research student experience, and you will have regular one-to-one meetings to discuss progress on your research. Initially, your supervisor will help you develop your research topic and plan.

Twice a year, you will have a supervisory board meeting, which provides a more formal opportunity to discuss your progress and agree your plans for the next six months.

Your technical and intellectual development will be enhanced by becoming part of a [research group](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences/research) and participating in School Seminars.

### Specialist facilities

Our School provides a comprehensive range of facilities for molecular medicine research:

* fully automated laboratories with robotic liquid handling systems and equipment for cell culture, molecular biology and gene editing* high-performance computing cluster with 368 CPUs, 5.4 Tb of RAM and 700 Tb of storage for analyses of large biological data sets* advanced bioimaging suite to visualise and process images of biological processes in real time* X-ray crystallography and macromolecular interactions facilities for the biophysical characterisation of proteins and other macromolecules* advanced bioimaging suite to visualise and analyse images of biological processes in real time* a range of facilities for cell and microbial culture* next-generation sequence analysis facilities

A dedicated study room allows all our postgraduate research students to have access to a desk and a computer outside of the research laboratories. This provides a focal point for our postgraduates, facilitating reading and writing as well as good communication and a sense of community.

### Your future

Many of our postgraduates continue their scientific research by taking up postdoctoral positions in the UK and overseas. Others have embarked on [careers](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences/careers) in biomedical laboratories and in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, both in research and development. We support your career development via a mentoring scheme and employability events.

### English language requirements

If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 6.5 overall, or equivalent, with a score of 5.5 in all other components.

## Structure

### Course structure

A research degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: COMPULSORY

[View Biological Science - Research on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=BS999&year=25)

### Assessment

The aim of undertaking your PhD within our School of Life Sciences is to train you to become an independent researcher who can critically assess research work, and who has a comprehensive understanding of at least one area of biology.

An MSD involves a minimum of one year of full-time research or two years part-time, followed by the production of a dissertation. Students enrolled on an MSD programme can upgrade to an MPhil or PhD, subject to satisfactory progress.

### Dissertation

You must attend two formal supervisory board meetings each year where you submit literature reviews and research reports to the Board members prior to the meeting. At these meetings, such documents are discussed with you and your progress is assessed.

Your MSD thesis is generally completed within one to two years and has a maximum length of 30,000 words.

## Fees and funding

### Home/UK fee

£5,006 per year

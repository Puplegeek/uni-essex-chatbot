**This course is temporarily suspended for the 2025-26 and 2026-27 academic years.**

Our MSc Artificial Intelligence in Finance course offers a dynamic blend of financial theory and cutting-edge AI technologies. You will study topics such as algorithmic trading, risk management, and financial modelling, all enhanced by AI techniques like machine learning and natural language processing.

This course equips you with the skills to revolutionise traditional finance practices, driving innovation in areas like automated trading strategies and fraud detection. With a strong foundation in both finance and AI, you will be poised to excel in roles at investment firms, banks, fintech start-ups, and beyond, shaping the future of finance through data-driven insights and intelligent decision-making.

In addition to traditional topics in financial econometrics and market microstructure theory, we put special emphasis on areas such as:

* statistical and computational methods* machine learning models for finance* modelling trading strategies and predictive services that are deployed by hedge funds* algorithmic trading groups* analysis of derivatives* risk management

Our [Centre for Computational Finance and Economic Agents (CCFEA)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/computational-finance-and-economic-agents) is an innovative and laboratory-based teaching and research centre, with an international reputation for leading-edge, interdisciplinary work combining economic and financial modelling with computational implementation. [Postgraduate study](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/computational-finance-and-economic-agents/postgraduate-study) within CCFEA gives you rigorous training in the principles of quantitative finance and microeconomics, along with computational skills.

We are supported by Essex's highly rated Department of Economics, School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, and Essex Business School. That's why we are ranked 6th in the UK for research power in computer science (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021).

This course is available to study full-time or part-time.

Why we're great.

* Develop the essential operational skills needed for state-of-the-art computational methods for financial modelling.
* Study the use of financial market simulators for stress testing trading strategies and designing electronic trading platforms.
* Our Employability and Careers Centre is on hand to help with careers advice and planning. You will also have opportunities to present your research and travel to international conferences.

## Structure

### Course structure

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The following modules are based on the current course structure and may change in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: CORE

CCFEA MSc Dissertation

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY

Machine Learning for Finance

(15 CREDITS)

This module is a mix of theory and practice with big data cases in finance. Algorithmic and data science theories will be introduced and followed by a thorough introduction of data-driven algorithms for structures and unstructured data. Modern machine learning and data mining algorithms will be introduced with particular case studies on financial industry.

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY

Machine Learning

(15 CREDITS)

Humans can often perform a task extremely well (e.g., telling cats from dogs) but are unable to understand and describe the decision process followed. Without this explicit knowledge, we cannot write computer programs that can be used by machines to perform the same task. “Machine learning” is the study and application of methods to learn such algorithms automatically from sets of examples, just like babies can learn to tell cats from dogs simply by being shown examples of dogs and cats by their parents. Machine learning has proven particularly suited to cases such as optical character recognition, dictation software, language translators, fraud detection in financial transactions, and many others.

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY

Computational Market Microstructure for FinTech and the Digital Economy

(20 CREDITS)

Equip yourself with principles of allocation and mechanism design from an operational perspective. Auction design and market microstructure of the stock market, liquidity provision in electronic financial markets such as dark pools, and capital adequacy of centralized clearing platforms are some of the specific applications that will be studied in the first part of this module. During the second part, you will be introduced to complexity economics of self-organisation, network modules, and strategic proteanism. Finally, you'll use network models to study economic interactions.

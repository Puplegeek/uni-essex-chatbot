Accounting refers to a wide range of topics within a vast research field which covers themes including: management accounting, reporting and analysis and accountable accounting. You will explore qualitative and quantitative methods of research specifically designed to reflect the field of accounting.

MRes Accounting is designed for those who wish to follow a career in research and/or academia as there is a strong research focus in this degree, although there are some taught elements which will support your knowledge of the research field. An MRes is the ideal first step if you hope to progress to doctoral studies, such as PhD.

* theoretical stances underpinning different approaches to research
* how to design a research proposal, including construction of research questions and/or hypotheses
* launching and managing a research project, including data collection, analysis and interpretation
* corporate reporting and analysis
* management accounting

We equip you with the skills and knowledge to appreciate the depth and breadth of accounting theories and techniques and apply these within a social science context. You benefit from cutting edge research conducted by our [Accounting Group](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-business-school/research/accounting-group) who specialise in accounting, accountability and global development.

At [Essex Business School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-business-school). we champion ethical management and sustainable business. We believe accounting information is the foundation for successful decision-making and further develop your practical accounting skills and theoretical knowledge so you can make a positive impact in the workplace or in accounting research.

Why we're great.

* This course is the perfect first step towards a PhD in accounting.
* Join both thriving research centres that support the world-leading accounting research conducted at Essex Business School.
* Enjoy the flexibility to choose some modules to ensure you have the perfect foundation for your chosen research topic.

### Our expert staff

Essex Business School has a number of established research strengths in accounting, including:

* accounting in emerging economies
* sustainable accounting
* governance
* global development
* public sector accounting
* regulation and reporting

Our researchers make a significant impact on the lives of people all around the world, with past and current research projects covering five continents.

The experience and findings of our experts will feature throughout your teaching. For example, you'll hear from  [Professor Thankom Arun](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/arunt05805/thankom-arun), Professor of Global Development and Accountability.

Professor Arun recently led an international team exploring how to mainstream the financial inclusion agenda, which attracted nearly £200,000 from UK-India Education and Research Initiative (UKIERI). The research has led to better access to financial services, such as insurance protection, for those most in need and policy changes to help improve the economic resilience of low-income families at risk across Africa and Asia.

In fact, Thankom's research on micro-insurance spans five countries and covers a population of over 10 million people. One under-served group impacted by his research are women start-up entrepreneurs in India as his work underpinned the development of a gender framework for running rehabilitation camps in emergency contexts.

Two research centres support the research activities taking place in the accounting group. They organise seminars by external invited speakers; Essex Business School staff and research students; co-ordinate workshop programmes; and schedule bi-annual conferences of international renown. These offer a further excellent opportunity for you to engage with the very latest research and ideas in the field of accounting.

[Essex Accounting Centre](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/accounting) conducts distinctive world-class research, with a particular focus on accounting research applied in developing countries, including topics such as social responsibility and corporate governance; management accounting change; and corruption and accountability.

Our interdisciplinary centre,  [the Centre for Accountability and Global Development (CAGD)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/accountability-and-global-development), is a dynamic hub for social justice research, with a particular focus on accountability across all sectors in both developed and emerging economies. The Centre contributes to impactful global development through rigorous research and engagement with the policy community, which complements the existing research strengths and expertise established within the Essex Accounting Centre.

## Structure

### Course structure

We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of core/compulsory modules, and optional modules chosen from lists. Please be aware that we are planning changes to our first year to make it more relevant to your chosen course.

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The following modules are based on the current course structure and may change in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

[View Research Methods in Accounting on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=BE951&year=25)

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY

Philosophies of Research and Advanced Qualitative Research Methods

(20 CREDITS)

This module is designed to build on your knowledge and understanding of research in management, marketing, accounting and organisation studies and to develop your skills in studying organisational life. Its aim is to draw together insights from the philosophy of the social sciences, methodology and advanced qualitative research methods in order to develop an informed and reflexive understanding of research design and practice.
A key part of your learning process on this module will develop your ability to connect an informed understanding of the philosophical underpinnings of organisational research with your planned methodological approach and methods of data collection and analysis.
Underpinning the module is an understanding of the research process not as a unidirectional, linear trajectory but as a complex and multi-dimensional back and forth process through which ideas evolve that coalesce into a research design that is specific to particular research projects and researchers and which enables those projects to proceed ethically and credibly.

The Essex Master in Public Policy is designed to give you, our future leaders, extensive knowledge of how actors in the public and private sectors formulate, decide and implement public policy. It introduces key concepts and theories for understanding the foundation of public policies, incentives and constraints governing the process of policy making, as well as the political realities faced by private and public sector institutions.

The Essex MPP introduces you to all aspects of the policy process, including policy formulation, implementation and evaluation. It showcases the role of interest groups and civil society in all stages of this process and helps you analyse the politics that underlie policy adaptation.

The course covers a wide range of policy areas, including:

* Education* Health* Environment* The role of taxation

In an increasingly complex world, our graduates can expect to acquire the analytic and data literacy skills which are indispensable building blocks for careers in making, implementing or shaping public policies in the public sector, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector, both nationally and globally.

This course is available with a January and October entry point.

Why we're great.

* The Essex MPP course combines an applied public policy approach with training in data analysis and cutting edge analytic skills, in which the Department of Government is world leading

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

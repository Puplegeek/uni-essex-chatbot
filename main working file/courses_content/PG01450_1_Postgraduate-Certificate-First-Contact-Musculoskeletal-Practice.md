October 2025

Study mode: 
Part-time

Duration:

Our Postgraduate Certificate First Contact Musculoskeletal Practice course enables experienced musculoskeletal clinicians to gain academic recognition for their First Contact Practitioner training. The content of this course has been aligned with guidance from all national and professional groups involved in the development and delivery of this role.

The first module, *First Contact Musculoskeletal Practice*, has been designed to map to Stage 1 requirements of Health Education England's 'Roadmap to Practice', and the second module, *Evaluation of Clinical Practice for First Contact Musculoskeletal Practitioners*, evidences the Stage 2 clinical competencies. You explore topics relating to FCP practice, including:

* communication strategies* screening for sinister pathology* integration of the wider determinants of health* operational issues* professional accountability

A clinical mentor is required to support your clinical learning, but this mentor does not need to be 'Roadmap trained'.

Completing this course will enable you to demonstrate:

* advanced understanding of key concepts related to advanced musculoskeletal practice in primary care* knowledge of how to assess complex health needs in the primary care environment (musculoskeletal presentations), diagnose, prescribe, and provide individualised care* knowledge of the relationships between diseases and the wider determinants of health, e.g. psycho-social theories and individuals' responses to health and illness* knowledge of how to critically appraise research findings and apply research evidence to question routine practice, including relevant ethical and legal issues* advanced ability to reflect upon your own professional practice

### Professional accreditation

Accredited by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP).

Why we're great.

* Teaching and assessment focuses on enabling high-quality patient-centred musculoskeletal care.
* Tutors provide excellent support to help you achieve academic, professional, and clinical requirements.
* Course structure and organisation are designed to minimise barriers to learning; you do not need to travel to campus, and study leave requirements are limited.

### Our expert staff

We have a range of University of Essex staff and external expert specialists who work with us. This pathway is supported by clinicians including FCPs and other experts, such as rheumatologists.

### Specialist facilities

This course does not require attendance at the University of Essex but you will have access to facilities including online resources, such as the library and a digital learning environment.

### Your future

This course will enable you, as a clinician, to gain academic recognition for your FCP education. It is suitable for clinicians employed as FCPs, and for those intending to apply for this role, please be aware that the full pathway requires clinical supervision in musculoskeletal primary care.

#### Sport scholarships

Our [Performance Sport Scholarship](https://www.essex.ac.uk/scholarships/sports-scholarships-and-bursaries) programme has been created for talented athletes playing at regional, national or international level, and offers a range of benefits. We want students competing in our focus sports - basketball, volleyball, tennis and football - as well as other team sports and as individual athletes to contribute to our performance sport programme.

Our scholarships can include fee discounts of up to 100%, offered to athletes who demonstrate sporting excellence. Athletes who are awarded the scholarship may also receive a host of other benefits, including:

* free kit* access to state-of-the-art facilities* performance coaching* the option to live in our Athlete Village (accommodation fees may vary)* a support package valued up to £1,500

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

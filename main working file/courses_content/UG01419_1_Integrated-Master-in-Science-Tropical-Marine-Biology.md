Dive into our MSci Tropical Marine Biology course and enter a fascinatingly complex world of whales, coral reefs, fish, deep sea trenches, coastal lagoons, sea ice, and tropical seagrass beds.

At Essex, we believe in a truly immersive experience of research and study. This includes numerous opportunities to go on field trips as part of this course (subject to additional costs). During the field trip to Wakatobi Marine National Park in Indonesia, our students are able to participate in underwater lectures.

Tropical ecosystems provide important resources locally and globally, and coral reefs are the most diverse of marine ecosystems threatened by human activities. Our unique course is designed to deliver advanced tropical marine biology theory and to facilitate the development of a comprehensive range of practical and professional skills required by today's employers.

The vast majority of life on earth is found under the sea; but exactly how much remains unknown, since there is so much still to be explored. At Essex, we'll take you on a journey of discovery from the poles to the tropical reef systems of the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans. We work on ecosystems from estuaries and coastal environments to oceanic systems, and on conservation and resource management.

You gain an expert knowledge of marine biology through study of essential core modules and the flexibility to specialise in the areas that interest you most, including:

* The major types of marine communities, including aquatic mammals and fish* Direct and indirect human impact on the marine environment* Coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangrove systems* Marine and freshwater taxonomy and biodiversity* Diving and snorkel-based practices

With our Integrated Masters you'll be able to fast track your degree and complete your final year in nine months compared to a regular MSc which usually takes twelve months. The course will cover key skills in tropical marine biology and provide you with the knowledge, understanding and hands-on experience required in this exciting and important area of research.

Topics include:

* The biotechnological ‘treasure chest' of marine microbes, algae and invertebrates* Tropical oceans, seagrass beds, mangroves and coral reefs* Coral reef resource management and conservation

When you combine your undergraduate and postgraduate study in one degree you'll be equipped with a strong theoretical background, specialist expertise through independent research and practical insights into current applications. This combination makes graduates from our course attractive candidates for many employers.

Your independent research project allows you to develop your own interests. Previous topics have included shellfisheries and water quality, turtle ecology in Greece and coral reef conservation strategies in the Caribbean and Indonesia.

We’re ranked 54th (14th in UK) for promoting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal for climate action (Times Higher Education Impact Rankings 2024).

Visit our [marine biology subject page](https://www.essex.ac.uk/subjects/marine-biology) for more information and content.

Why we're great.

* Develop your marine biology research skills with our in-house Coral Reef Research Unit.
* Gain hands-on experience of coral reef conservation in the Wakatobi Marine National Park, Indonesia.
* We are ranked 1st in the UK for biology (The Mail University Guide 2025) and 7th for biology (non-specific) for overall positivity score (National Student Survey 2024, English broad-discipline higher education institutions).

### Study abroad

Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The five-year version of our Integrated Masters allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the four-year Integrated Masters.

Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.

If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university.

### Placement year

Alternatively, you can spend your third year on a [placement year](http://www.essex.ac.uk/careers/placements/default.aspx) with an external organisation. This is usually focussed around your course, and enables you to learn about a particular sector, company or job role, apply your academic knowledge in a practical working environment, and receive inspiration for future career pathways.

If you complete a placement year you'll only pay 20% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |

Microbiology

(15 CREDITS)

Microbes are essential for life, playing a vital role in connecting the health of humans, animals, and ecosystems. They aid in digestion, provide essential vitamins, and contribute significantly to our overall health and well-being. Marine microbes, for instance, produce approximately one-third of the oxygen we breathe. Additionally, microbes are indispensable for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, as they clean up pollutants and synthesize valuable products like antibiotics. However, not all microbes are beneficial - some cause devastating diseases. Despite significant advances in treatment and prevention, the incidence of infectious diseases continues to rise. In this module, you will explore the vast diversity and evolution of mostly beneficial microbes, alongside the pathogenicity of harmful ones. You will investigate how different viruses and bacteria invade, interact with, and replicate within their hosts. Through two practical sessions in our state-of-the-art teaching laboratory, you will study a food poisoning outbreak and will gain hands-on experience in growing, observing, purifying, counting, and even killing microbes. These sessions will equip you with highly sought-after skills, including aseptic technique, serial dilution, and data analysis.

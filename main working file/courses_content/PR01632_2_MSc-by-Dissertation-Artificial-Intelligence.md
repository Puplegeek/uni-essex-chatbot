We offer research supervision for our MSD Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all areas related to AI:

* explainable AI* generative AI* analytics and data science* natural language and information processing* games and AI future health* technology and theoretical AI.

We provide a vibrant research environment so you can publish papers in prestigious international journals and conferences and attract the attention of industry and government.

We have an international reputation for cutting-edge interdisciplinary work combining AI, health, finance, psychology and life sciences.

Our research is geared towards practical applications, and many of our academic staff have experience applying their findings in industry and in advising the UK Government.

Why we're great.

* Our research covers all aspects of AI research within a School ranked sixth in Research Power in the UK Research Excellence framework for the world-leading research we are conducting.
* Join one of the largest AI research groups in the UK alongside world leaders in their domains.
* We provide an active and stimulating environment to carry out your research.

### Our expert staff

Studying for your MSD involves person-to-person interaction with your supervisor, who will guide you in developing your chosen research topic, refine your research skills, and advise you in capitalising on the technical knowledge you already have from your taught degree. [Supervisors](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering/people) often keep in touch with their MSD graduates throughout their careers, and may work on scientific collaborations with them after they finish their doctorate.

You also have access to our AI research group of world leaders in their domains, including IEEE Fellow and IET Fellows, most of whom are highly cited authors with deep expertise in their subjects.

### Specialist facilities

As an MSD student, you will become a member of our [AI research group](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering/research/artificial-intelligence). It encompasses five associated special interest groups:

* [Analytics and Data Science](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering/research/artificial-intelligence#analytics-and-data-science)
* [Computational Finance and Economics](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering/research/artificial-intelligence#computational-finance-and-economics)
* [Natural Language and Information Processing](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering/research/artificial-intelligence#natural-language-and-information-processing)
* [Games and AI](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering/research/artificial-intelligence#games-and-ai)
* [Future Health and Technology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering/research/artificial-intelligence#future-health-and-technology)

The AI group is at the core of the [ESRC Business and Local Government Data Research Centre](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/business-and-local-government-data), and contributes via the Institute for Analytics and Data Science (IADS) to the [ESRC Research Centre on Micro-Social Change](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/misoc) (MiSoC).

### English language requirements

If English is not your first language, then we will require you to have IELTS 6.0 with a minimum of 5.5 in each component

## Structure

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

*The University makes every effort to ensure that this information on its programme specification is accurate and up-to-date. Exceptionally it can be necessary to make changes, for example to courses, facilities or fees. Examples of such reasons might include, but are not limited to: strikes, other industrial action, staff illness, severe weather, fire, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack (whether declared or not), natural disaster, restrictions imposed by government or public authorities, epidemic or pandemic disease, failure of public utilities or transport systems or the withdrawal/reduction of funding. Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our [programme specifications](http://www.essex.ac.uk/programmespecs/). The University would inform and engage with you if your course was to be discontinued, and would provide you with options, where appropriate, in line with our Compensation and Refund Policy.*

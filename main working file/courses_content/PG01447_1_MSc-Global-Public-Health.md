Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Health and Social Care (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care)

Society the world over is faced with mounting public health challenges, from pandemics to forced displacement, to rapidly depleting planetary resources. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed the complex links between population health, and the wider economic, social, political, environmental, and commercial determinants that shape human and planetary health in the globalised world we inhabit. Our MSc Global Public Health will challenge you to investigate these intersecting issues, critically appraise health and public policies, and engage in innovative research to drive forward change that contributes to a more equitable, sustainable, and healthy future.

Globally, most nations have committed to the international human rights framework and the UN Sustainable Development Agenda pledge to “leave no one behind”. However, progress on these promises requires an understanding of the root causes of mounting global inequity as well as the role intersecting crises play in driving increased inequity and distracting from the necessity of structural reform. Developing a deeper understanding of interlinkages will help you develop a foundation from which you'll explore the increasingly political role of multinational corporations and other powerful actors (such as charitable foundations) in influencing global and national decision-making. This course will equip you with the academic knowledge and skillset to analyse the impact of structural forms of discrimination including racism and colonialism, both in the UK and internationally, so that you can contribute to addressing the roots of the ensuing social injustice this discrimination perpetuates.

Through a combination of interactive lectures and intensive seminars with practitioners and leading experts, this course will help you develop a comprehensive and critical understanding of:

* what factors determine our health;* what drives decision-making and priority setting in global health?* who governs health, how (i.e. policies and mechanisms) and with what effects at individual, societal, national, and global levels;* how people, illnesses, and drugs/ therapies travel in a globalised world? How these movements relate to the movement of capital and trade?* how wider inequalities (based on class, gender, sexuality among others) and systems of oppression interact to shape people's life chances and ability to thrive?* And importantly, what skills, approaches, interventions, actions can help resist the detrimental forces that undermine health and well-being and realise the promises of “health for all” and “leave no one behind” to achieve fairer, equitable, and healthier societies?

You'll benefit from the opportunity to pursue this course through one of two specialist pathways. Each pathway will share some core modules but allow flexibility for you to select modules that are in line with your interests and employment. You can either opt to follow our ‘Policy and Systems' pathway which has been designed with an emphasis on preparing you for entering the workforce with strong evidence-based research and planning skills, or our ‘Intersectional Inequalities and Determinants' pathway which will advance your interdisciplinary skills in examining and tackling inequalities in the distribution of determinants of health and diseases.

Why we're great.

* You'll gain practical knowledge and transferable research and evaluation skills necessary for pursuing a career in public health policy and practice.
* You'll enhance your research skills by applying theoretical and methodological learnings to real life public health challenges.
* You'll develop the analytical and methodological skills necessary for applying an innovative intersectional lens to examine policy and health inequalities.

### Our expert staff

Essex is home to wide-ranging methodological, disciplinary, and subject area expertise. The degree will be located in the Interdisciplinary Research and Practice Division within the School of Health and Social Care. It will draw on eminent scholars from diverse subject areas within the School and across, including the renowned Human Rights Centre, the Law Faculty, and the ISER institute. You will also benefit from the dynamic networks of academic, policy, and practitioner communities that our staff work closely with, in the UK, Europe, and internationally.

Equality, social justice, and social activism are part of the DNA of the School of Health and Social Care here at the University of Essex. The course both builds on and extends these values offering distinct opportunities to contribute to these goals.

[Dr Valentina Iemmi](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/IEMMI99801/valentina-iemmi) and [Dr Ursula Read](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/READU29709/ursula-read) direct our MSc Global Public Health programme. Dr Ursula Read directs our January start cohorts, and Dr Valentina Iemmi directs our October start cohorts.

Valentina's research focuses on global mental health policy. Her work investigates governance, analysing why and how global actors support mental health worldwide and how they can improve their collective responses. She uses innovative and rigorous multi-methods at global level, primarily qualitative (interviews and documentary analyses) and also quantitative (country-level panel data linkage and analyses). She uses multi-disciplinary approaches, primarily health policy and international relations, and also psychology, public policy, and economics. Her most recent work explored a particular group of actors in the global mental health system: external actors investing in mental health in low- and middle-income countries. She is currently examining the global mental health governance structure and the prioritisation of mental health at global level.

Ursula is a qualitative researcher with research interests in global mental health, social justice, and the involvement of communities in mental health care. Her work explores the lived experiences of mental illness and care, particularly in the Global South, with a focus on Ghana. She has conducted extensive research on the impact of mental illness on family life, ethical dilemmas around care and consent, and the relationship between psychiatric services and traditional and faith healers. Ursula has expertise in ethnographic, qualitative, participatory, and arts-based methodologies, using creative approaches to amplify the voices of people with lived experience of mental health challenges.

This programme was established by Professor Kapilashrami, an Interdisciplinary social scientist of international repute with expertise in health policy and systems research, and a particular interest in the interface between equity, rights, and social justice. Professor Kapilashrami has longstanding experience in the academia and working with civil society and policy makers. Her current work focuses on advancing intersectionality, conceptually and empirically, to examine and address health inequalities and structural determinants of health (including migration).

Dr Valentina Iemmi and Dr Ursula Read will be joined by other leading experts in the University (including [Professor Anuj Kapilashrami](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/KAPIL61907/anuj-kapilashrami), [Professor Reza Majdzadeh](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/MAJDZ13703/reza-majdzadeh), [Dr Sarita Panday](https://www.essex.ac.uk/%E2%80%9Chttps:/www.essex.ac.uk/people/PANDA72102/sarita-panday%E2%80%9D) ,
 [Dr Milagros Ruiz](https://www.essex.ac.uk/%E2%80%9Chttps:/www.essex.ac.uk/people/RUIZM80700/milagros-ruiz%E2%80%9D) ,
[Professor Ewen Speed](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/SPEED44207/ewen-speed), [Professor Fay Crawford](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/CRAWF07905/fay-crawford), [Professor Andrew Bateman](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/BATEM29808/andrew-bateman)) and beyond with speakers representing diverse sectors and geographies.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: CORE

Global Public Health Research Dissertation

(60 CREDITS)

A dissertation in Global Public Health is a research project that you structure and lead. Dissertations offer the opportunity for in-depth study and analysis of a topic relevant to Global Public Health. It gives you the chance to pursue a topic that you are interested in in-depth and to develop research and independent study skills. These may take one of four general forms:
Literature review: an extended literature review of a relevant policy, intervention, or practice issue in global public health;
Quantitative/qualitative analysis (secondary data): new analysis of existing quantitative or qualitative data (i.e., secondary data) related to a relevant policy, intervention, or practice issue in global public health;
Quantitative/qualitative analysis (primary data): collection and analysis of new data (i.e., primary data) through primary research using quantitative and/or qualitative methods, related to a relevant policy, intervention, or practice issue in global public health; and
Health policy analysis: an in-depth analysis of a relevant policy in global public health.
Whatever type of dissertation you decide to prepare, you are expected to demonstrate your ability to engage critically and analytically with literature in the field, building upon relevant concepts and theory covered in the taught element of the degree. You need to show knowledge of relevant research methodology and data analysis.

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY

Introduction to Global Health

(15 CREDITS)

The global health priorities established in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have helped bring the importance of global health governance to the fore of global health scholarship. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has shone a spotlight on global public health governance, exposing the systemic weaknesses in the global health architecture and demonstrating how power and resource imbalances impact on global health policy, global health equity and population health.
The global health landscape is shaped by centuries old interactions and structures. The past few decades have brought dramatic change shaped by cross-border flows of capital, ideas, technology intermediated through the complex interaction between global, national and local actors and institutions. This module provides an introduction to the fundamentals of global public health governance by focusing on health-related issues that transcend national boundaries and the differential impacts of globalization on health. It introduces essential concepts from the social sciences, including political science, sociology and law. It includes critical scholarship on interactions between global and local actors to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary for critically exploring key questions including who governs global health, which states, institutions and other entities finances global health, who sets priorities for global health and who is accountable for delivering on global health commitments. It provides an introduction to understanding the diverse social, economic and political forces which shape how and why some important health related challenges are addressed through global health policies, including the SDGs, and others are not.

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY

Social Determinants of Health

(15 CREDITS)

The module will introduce you to the skills required for ethical practice in the context of safeguarding and protection of children, young people and vulnerable adults. The module also aims to introduce you to the skills related to legislation and regulation including advocacy and legal research skills.
You will have the opportunity to explore the process of ethical decision-making alongside students and tutors from the Law Clinic. Law, and Health and Social Care staff will be making use of the giving voice to values approach which focuses on empowering decision making for transformational leadership.

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY

Introduction to Epidemiology

(15 CREDITS)

This is an introductory module which provides a foundation in the field of epidemiology. Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health and disease in specified human populations. The purpose of epidemiology is to guide public health in the prevention, surveillance, and control of health disorders and states of illness. This module adopts a global perspective, and draws on global health data, statistics, and evidence, as appropriate. Previous knowledge in public health or population health is useful, but not required.

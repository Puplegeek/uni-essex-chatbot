## Overview

The details

Course: 
Statistics

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
4 - 5 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science)

An Integrated PhD provides a route into research study if you do not have a Masters degree, or have very little research training. It enables you to spend your first year completing a Masters-level qualification, followed by a full-time PhD studied over three to four years. We also offer a [‘standard' PhD](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pr00992/1/phd-statistics) in this subject which can be studied either full-time (three to four years) or part-time (six to seven years).

Statistics is one of the most important fields of study in the world. The techniques we use to model and manipulate data guide the political, financial and social decisions that shape our modern society. If you are a logical person and enjoy solving problems, statistics at Essex is for you.

Our [School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science) embraces pure mathematics, applied mathematics and statistics, and operational research, and our course offers you the opportunity to study statistics alongside other mathematical subjects.

Providing a balance of solid statistical theory and practical application, the first year of our Integrated PhD Statistics builds on your knowledge in all areas of statistics, data analysis and probability.

In your second year you move onto the PhD element of the course. We have staff members available to act as supervisors across a number of areas within statistics, such as:

* statistical modelling and smoothing* Bayesian computational statistics* nonparametric statistics* longitudinal analysis

You are also invited to contact our School to discuss other potential research areas.

Our interdisciplinary research recognises that mathematics, including what can be very abstract mathematics, is an essential part of research in many other disciplines.

All Essex research students have access to our innovative and unique scheme, [Proficio](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/proficio). Postgraduate research students are automatically enrolled on Proficio, which provides a variety of training courses and a fund of up to £2,500 per student for conference attendance and relevant external training courses.

Why we're great.

* Build your knowledge in all areas of statistics, data analysis, and probability – specialise in many areas including survey methodology, operations research, and applied mathematics.
* We have a strong track record on knowledge transfer partnerships funded by Innovate UK and ESRC with businesses and governments across the region and beyond.
* Our School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science has an internationally excellent reputation in areas such as algebraic geometry, group theory, semigroup theory, differential equations, optimisation, probability, applied statistics, bioinformatics and mathematical biology.

### English language requirements

If English is not your first language , we require IELTS 6.0, or equivalent with a minimum of 5.5 in all other components.

## Structure

### Course structure

Most of our taught courses combine compulsory and optional modules, giving you freedom to pursue your own interests. All of the modules listed below provide an example of what is on offer from the current academic year. Our Programme Specification provides further details of the course structure for the current academic year.

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.

The research element of your degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

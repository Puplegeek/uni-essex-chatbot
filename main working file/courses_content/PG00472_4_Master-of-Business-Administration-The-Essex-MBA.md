> "I am a qualified solicitor and still have a full-time job to alongside studying part-time. I also do voluntary work and have a young family. It’s a balancing act! I am super organised and set time aside to ensure that I can get everything done. Having a legal background is useful but I am learning so much about business from the tutors and my fellow student cohort. I am really enjoying coming back to study as a mature student. Being older with professional and life experience is invaluable and means I get more from the content being delivered. In terms of the programme, I particularly enjoyed the module ‘leading with impact’, as this is very relevant to my professional life as a solicitor specialising in employment law, with a passion for helping businesses get the best from their employees and creating great places to work."

### English language requirements

  

If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 6.5 overall with a minimum score of 6.0 in all components.

If you do not meet our IELTS requirements then you may be able to complete a [pre-sessional English
pathway](https://www.essex.ac.uk/international/pre-sessional/) that enables you to start your course without retaking IELTS.

### Additional Notes

The University uses academic selection criteria to determine an applicant’s ability to
successfully complete a course at the University of Essex. Where appropriate, we may ask
for specific information relating to previous modules studied or work experience.

## Structure

### Course structure

The Essex MBA is structured around eight core modules, the MBA Essentials, and three further modules, the MBA toolkit, that leverage Essex Business School's distinct areas of expertise.

You will also have the opportunity to select an elective module, from a selection called the MBA options, that is aligned to your interests and aspirations.

These are followed by the Capstone, which is the culmination of the practical Director's Workshops and business simulations that run throughout the year, and is your opportunity to complete a consultancy project, business plan or dissertation.

All of the modules listed below provide an example of what is on offer from the current academic year.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

### Teaching

Each module is delivered in a one-week period, including three or four days of module workshops, where you work alongside your classmates to explore case studies, share relevant professional experiences and apply your learning to real business and management situations.

For some modules you may be required or recommended to complete some prior learning before the module begins, making use of Moodle, the University's virtual learning environment.

For other modules you may engage with this content after the module workshops have taken place.

On Moodle, you will find a set of learning resources for each module which may include quizzes, exercises and articles, specially selected by the module leader. You can work through the materials at your own pace, spending more time on areas that you find challenging.

Shortly after the module workshops, you'll have one more group meeting with the MBA teaching team to ensure you have everything you need to begin work on the assignment or assessment for the module.

### Assessment

Assessment for each taught module usually consists of coursework as there are no exams for this programme. Coursework takes the form of individual written essays, group projects and presentations. The Business Planning module is provided to support you with your final MBA Project.

### Dissertation

You are required to complete one of the following:

* dissertation - using robust research methods and tools to explore specific business issues of your choice
* comprehensive business plan - a structured business planning document for a new or growing business
* consultancy project - you will be linked with a local business and produce a case study of an issue specific to the business

The details

International Journalism

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Literature, Film, and Theatre Studies](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/literature-film-and-theatre-studies)

MA International Journalism is created for students who are seeking to take their journalism experience to an advanced level as well as for students who have no background in journalism but are eager to supplement their academic knowledge with journalism skills. The course is also open to people with degrees in other fields or with equivalent professional experience.

It introduces you to the theory and practice of journalism in a global context. It has an international scope and deals with the practice of journalism across different media, cultural and regulatory environments. You will have the option to tailor your studies by choosing a practice- or theory-led route depending on your interests and career ambitions. The practice track is useful for students who are coming from other disciplines but want to supplement their knowledge with journalism skills; the theory track is useful for those considering a research degree, such as a PhD in journalism studies.

Our MA is the first in UK to offer complete training in cutting-edge Open-Source Journalism techniques. The course is also enhanced by its link to Essex's prestigious Human Rights Centre, which will give you an opportunity to contribute directly to issues of contemporary significance by participating in the Digital Verification Corps.

You can study the course as a one-year full-time degree or as a two-year part-time degree.

### English language requirements

  

If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 7.0 overall with a minimum
component score of 6.5 in writing and 5.5 in all other components.

### Additional Notes

The University uses academic selection criteria to determine an applicant’s ability to
successfully complete a course at the University of Essex. Where appropriate, we may ask
for specific information relating to previous modules studied or work experience.

## Structure

### Course structure

Students will be required to complete four core modules, each worth 20 credits, before they take on a project or dissertation worth 80 credits. They will also get to pick an optional module from Human Rights, Creative Writing, Film, Politics, and Sociology depending on their preference. These are the core modules:

**Journalism Practice 1**

This is the core practice module. It will focus mainly on reporting, writing, and digital skills. The aim is to give students the ability to research newsworthy stories and write with accuracy, brevity, and clarity. The first four sessions will focus on news writing. The next three will focus on feature writing. The last three sessions will be devoted to podcasting, with an emphasis on storytelling.

**Journalism Practice 2**

This module focuses on visual storytelling. It starts with photography since composition, lighting, and subject are fundamental to all visual stories. Students then introduce the element of motion through mobile journalism. The module ends with rigorous training in editing techniques. Throughout, students will deconstruct and analyze the best works of visual storytelling so they can adapt or incorporate the same ideas for their own stories.

**Open Source Journalism**

This module starts with traditional investigative research methods—analysing documents, using archives, accessing public records, using FOIA. The latter half will focus entirely on cutting edge, digital open source journalism where students will learn to collect, analyse and document publicly available online information for use in law, advocacy, or journalism. They will learn to authenticate audio-visual data, geolocate photos and videos, and mine social media for useful information. Students will also learn advanced fact-checking methods.

**International Journalism**

This module forms the conceptual core of the degree. It introduces students to key issues in international journalism and the practical challenges of gathering and reporting news in an international context. It complements students' practical skills with analytical tools to address contemporary trends in global journalism and an understanding of different political, regulatory, and cultural contexts. Students will also gain knowledge from experienced foreign correspondents on the practicalities of reporting from conflict zones, minimizing risks and handling constraints.

**Journalism Project**

For students taking the practice track, the Journalism Project is the culmination of the MA International Journalism. It gives them the opportunity to develop and demonstrate their skills as a journalist as they devise and investigate their own topic with a written submission of 10,000 – 12,000 words OR a 20 minute documentary podcast OR a 15 minute video documentary.

**Journalism Dissertation**

For students taking the academic track, the Journalism Dissertation is the culmination of the MA International Journalism. It gives students the opportunity to develop and demonstrate their skills as an academic researcher as they devise and investigate their own topic with a written academic dissertation of 15,000 words (excluding bibliography and footnotes) on an issue of contemporary relevance in journalism studies.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

Are you interested in conducting impactful research that seeks to address some of the pressing societal challenges of today? The PhD in Psychology allows you to work one-on-one with one of our expert staff members and focus your attention on designing, conducting, and writing up innovative psychological studies.

Supervision for PhD Psychology within our [Department of Psychology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology) is available in diverse fields of psychology, including but not limited to:

* cognitive psychology* social and cognitive neuroscience* social psychology* developmental psychology

You study in a stimulating and vibrant research environment, and we provide excellent research facilities. In general, our students enjoy the same access to neuroscience and other research equipment as our academic staff, and access to our research participant pool which is essential for your experimental research.

You also benefit from the supportive supervision given by our staff, and the friendly and collegiate atmosphere provided by fellow students. This ensures that we have an exemplary record in supporting our MSD students to produce high-quality theses within one year.

You can study this full-time or part-time, starting in October, January or April.

We also offer an [Integrated PhD](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pr00972/4/phd-psychology) in this subject, which enables you to spend your first year completing a Masters-level qualification followed by a full-time PhD studied over three to four years.

Why we're great.

* We offer a range of PhD studentships and funding opportunities.
* We provide excellent state-of-the-art facilities for study, with extensive laboratory space for experimental psychology and special facilities for visual and auditory perception, developmental psychology and social psychology, with our Hearing Research Laboratory and our Visual Perception Unit.
* We also have our Centre for Brain Sciences (CBS), a state-of-the-art research facility dedicated to the study of brain activity in relation to psychological processes. This provides a dynamic resource for psychology and neuroscience with specialised laboratories for investigating brain activity.

### Our expert staff

Our [psychology lecturers](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/people) include [award-winning teachers and prize-winning researchers](https://www.essex.ac.uk/news/2022/02/01/veronica-lamarche-excellence-in-education) who are international experts in their own research areas.

Our staff carry out research into areas of psychology that fall under our three key themes:

* [thinking about the world](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/research/thinking-about-the-world)* [interacting with the world](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/research/interacting-with-the-world)* [experiencing the world](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/research/experiencing-the-world)

These themes help tie your knowledge together as they directly feed into our modules, where you can study how we remember things, what captures our attention, how relationships work, what our emotions do with us, or the impact of culture on ourselves and others.

Within our Department of Psychology, you will be allocated a supervisor whose role it is to guide you through the different stages of your research degree. In some cases, you may have joint supervision by two members of our staff.

* The support provided by your supervisor is a key feature of your research student experience and you will have regular one-to-one meetings to discuss progress on your research. Initially, your supervisor will help you develop your research topic and plan.
* Twice a year, you will have a supervisory panel meeting, which provides a more formal opportunity to discuss your progress and agree your plans for the next six months.

### Specialist facilities

We are committed to giving you access to [state-of-the-art facilities](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/facilities) in higher education, housed entirely within our purpose-built psychology building on our Colchester Campus:

* dedicated laboratories to employ a range of cutting-edge methodologies when carrying out your research projects* specialist areas to study visual and auditory perception, developmental psychology, and social psychology* a virtual reality suite and an observation suite* our Babylab, the leading infant lab in the East of England that explores perceptual, emotional, and cognitive processes in infants* our multimillion-pound Centre for Brain Science (CBS), which allows staff and students to investigate brain activity (including electrophysiology (EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)) and houses a range of facilities to measure eye movements and physiological responses (such as heart rate and skin conductance)* a first-of-its-kind dedicated [Minecraft Lab](https://60stories.essex.ac.uk/minecraft-the-power-of-play/index.html), which uses the popular game to study human behaviour in situations that might be impractical or unethical to recreate in the real world

### Your future

With the skills and knowledge you acquire from studying within our Department of Psychology, you will find yourself in demand from a wide range of employers. [Our graduates](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/careers) have been employed in clinical psychology, educational psychology, criminal and forensic psychology.

Many of the graduates from this course go onto further study and obtain their PhD in psychology or a related field. This allows graduates to pursue careers in research, academia, and clinical environments. The skills developed on this course also allow graduates to pursue careers such as:

* data analyst* research associate* consultant* data scientist* research coordinator

We also have excellent links with the research community and our postgraduate research students have taken up postdoctoral positions in other top UK and international universities (e.g. US, Italy, Australia), as well as being appointed to lectureships across the UK.

Sorry, the entry requirements for the country that you have selected are not available here. Please contact our Graduate Admissions team at [pgquery@essex.ac.uk](mailto:pgquery@essex.ac.uk) to request the entry requirements for this country.

### English language requirements

If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 7.0, or equivalent, with a minimum score of 5.5 in all other components.

## Structure

### Course structure

A research degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: COMPULSORY

Psychology - Research

(0 CREDITS)

This module is for PhD students who are completing the research portions of their theses.

[View Psychology - Research on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS999&year=25)

### Assessment

The award of a PhD signifies an original and substantial contribution to knowledge that means you can be considered an expert in your field. The majority of your learning comes from ‘hands-on' experience of designing, conducting, and analysing your original research, as well as from the demanding process of writing and submitting a PhD.

To help in this process, you attend several taught courses in your first year, and all our research students are required to undertake postgraduate research training modules.

At the end of your first and second years of study, you will prepare a 10,000-word document that contains a review of relevant literature and summarises findings from your empirical work. You will also take part in a postgraduate research conference, making an oral presentation of this work to the Department.

### Dissertation

Students within our Department of Psychology submit a dissertation of up to 80,000 words.

We take pride in our completion record with our PhD students. We achieve this, in part, by ensuring from the outset that you follow a clear path to ensure completion within three years, with specific appropriate milestones at the end of your first and second years.

## Fees and funding

### Home/UK fee

£5,006 per year

### International fee

£22,550 per year

Fees will increase for each academic year of study.

## Overview

The details

Course: 
Government

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
4 - 5 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Government](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/government)

Our four-year integrated PhD Government follows the [MSc Political Science](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg00725/2/msc-political-science) programme for year 1 before beginning the PhD study programme within the department in year 2. By opting for our four-year Integrated course, you will benefit from guidance and training to develop the research mind set needed for your PhD studies. On the first year of your studies you will receive training in research methods, followed by advanced research training and as your course progresses, expert supervision to reach your full potential, as well as access to top quality research facilities.

We are renowned especially for our expertise in the areas of:

* Political Behaviour* Comparative Politics* Ideology and Discourse Analysis* International Relations* Conflict Resolution* Political Theory

Whatever the field, Politics at Essex is all about moving from opinions to evidence. Always seeking out cause and effect, in our research, we cast light on important questions across the political range and also some that you may never have ordinarily connected to Politics or government.

Our PhD programme provides you with advanced research training and supervision by globally leading scholars. We work with you to analyse and explain significant political outcomes such as war and peace, transitions to democracy, the way governments shape the economy, or the results of the elections.

Why we're great.

* Our department at Essex was one of the first of its kind in the UK, and has throughout its fifty years been recognised as setting the highest standard for both the scientific and critical study of politics.
* 2nd in UK for research outputs in politics and international studies (Grade Point Average, REF 2021)
* As one of our PhD students, you're part of an active and prolific research team. Our students attend seminars, present at conferences, question speakers, and debates often continue in the common room, the café, or the bar.

### Our expert staff

The support provided by your supervisor is a key feature of your experience as a research student. Your supervisor – or, in some cases, co-supervisors – guides you through the different stages of your research degree. Initially they help you to develop your research topic and plan, and then you participate in regular one-to-one meetings to discuss drafts, resolve problems, and to maintain progress on your research. Twice a year you have a supervisory board meeting which provides a more formal opportunity to discuss your progress and agree your plans for the coming months.

Our dedicated staff present findings at international conferences and they have published in acclaimed political journals such as the *American Political Science Review*, the *American Journal of Political Science*, the *Journal of Politics*, the *British Journal of Political Science, World Politics, International Organization, Electoral Studies, International Studies Quarterly*, the *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, the *Journal of Peace Research*, the *Journal of Education*, and many more. They have also won a number of prestigious prizes for their work.

### Specialist facilities

* We have desk space available for all our PhD students through shared offices and hot desks, with additional office space provided for all those involved in teaching classes.* You also get exclusive use of a shared computer laboratory of fourteen networked computers that feature extensive software for political analysis. Our university library provides access to a variety of scientific journals and multiple copies of textbooks, e-books, and other materials to support your learning.

### Your future

Our department provides a number of training opportunities and support services to aid your studies and to help prepare you for employment:

* **Professional Development Seminar:** First-year PhD students are invited to a seminar focusing on writing and presenting a research proposal for your thesis, developing confidence in the presentation of academic papers, learning how to write and submit journal articles, and developing skills in time management and the use of technology.* **Research Design Seminar:**  We offer a research design module to our PhD students to sharpen their skills to develop high-class research.* **Weekly discussion seminars:** Each of the department's research divisions hosts a weekly research discussion workshop, where students discuss their progress with their peers and members of staff.* **Skills training:** The Essex ESRC Doctoral Training Centre offers training courses for doctoral students, including both advanced subject-specific training and a transferable skills programme.* **Teaching opportunities:**  Our department offers paid opportunities for both Graduate Teaching Assistants and Research Assistants.

Many of our graduates secure post-doctoral research or teaching positions within universities. For example, recent graduates are now research fellows and academic staff at Oxford, University College London, Glasgow, Munich, Mannheim, ETH Zürich, Amsterdam, and Duke University in the US.

Other graduates go on to enjoy influential careers in British, European and international politics. This includes working as political lobbyists or researchers for MPs and MEPs. Our graduates also work in the civil service and in local government, for the World Bank, the United Nations, NATO, YouGov, or in the armed forces, finance, and business.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

Professional Development Seminar

(0 CREDITS)

This module focuses on writing and presenting a research proposal for the thesis, as well as other significant aspects of socialization into the discipline of political science. We aim to help PhD candidates develop a wide range of professional skills, providing the capacity to complete your PhD and compete for academic jobs.
The primary focus is the academic profession. We therefore practise a number of specific skills such as drafting research proposals, presenting results, and publication strategies. However, many of the sessions are also highly relevant for the other kinds of professions in which PhD graduates often find employment. Whatever your target, we aim in this seminar to provide a constructively critical atmosphere in which to hone various skills.

### Teaching

The main way that PGR students engage with academic staff and with their research is through one-to-one meetings. PGR students meet with their co-supervisors, separately or together, at least once per month in one-to-one sessions. This is the main way that PGR students receive guidance on their PhD research and dissertation projects. It is during these meetings that students and supervisors discuss any areas for additional methodological and substantive training, as well as identify any modules or courses that can meet these needs. Students also meet with their Supervisor Panels twice per year. Supervisor Panels check that student progress adheres to yearly milestone targets (outlined in departmental documents), in terms of research and dissertation progress, as well as with methodological and substantive training progress.

### Dissertation

In your completion year you should be revising and rewriting chapters. You submit your approved thesis to an internal reader for comments, and then submit your final thesis before the end of the academic year.

We expect our PhD students to complete their PhD within four years of entering, so you are monitored regularly to ensure you are progressing.

## Fees and funding

### Home/UK fee

£5,006 per year

### International fee

£19,650 per year

Fees will increase for each academic year of study.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course.Â A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules fromÂ which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY

IP Networking and Applications

(15 CREDITS)

ThisÂ module introduces the Internet and computer networking from both a theoretical and practical perspective. It is the module where computersÂ are merging with communications to create a fundamentally newÂ system Â - the World Wide Web. The design, organisation, andÂ operation of networks and the Internet are the subject of this module. The areas whichÂ areÂ covered in the module are at the heart of modern network-connected world. In brief - the moduleÂ will provide you as a futureÂ computer network specialist with a comprehensive knowledge ofÂ design, organisation, and operating principles of modern computer networks. The moduleÂ first examines the architecture and operation of theÂ Internet Protocols (IPs), and shows how information is processed and routed acrossÂ the Internet. The operation and configuration of routers is discussed alongside the details of protocol operation. TheÂ module then discusses the rationale behind the next generation internet protocol IPv6, in particular regarding addressing architecture, header functions, and novel protocol concepts. A comparison between the current IPv4 and the future IPv6 protocols and transition to the next generation protocol are discussed in depth. The function and implementation of its main support protocols are also covered. The application of these new networking ideas is illustrated by the application of IPv6 to problems in network layer services, especially security, and the Internet of Things (IoT).Â  In order to provide both good theoretical knowledge andÂ strong applied skills, in addition to the lectures the module is supported by the problem solving classes.

(15 CREDITS)

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY

Computer Security

(15 CREDITS)

This course gives an introduction to computer security and cryptography, and then goes on to consider security as it relates to a single, network connected, computer. Introductory material is independent of any operating system but the consideration of tools will focus on those available for Linux, partly because its open-source nature facilitates this and partly because it is widely used on server systems. The introduction to cryptography will be used to consider its use in encryption and authentication.

[View Computer Security on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=CE708&year=25)

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY

Professional Practice and Research Methodology

(15 CREDITS)

This module aims to prepare students for conducting an independent research project leading to a dissertation and to provide them with an appreciation of research and business skills related to their professional career. As a precursor to their project students, individually select an area of Computer Science, or Electronic Engineering, or Computational Finance and perform the necessary background research to define a topic and prepare a project proposal under the guidance of a supervisor. The module guides them by a) introducing common research methods b) creating an understanding of basic statistics for describing and making conclusions from data c) helping to write a strong proposal including learning how to perform literature search and evaluation and d) giving an in-depth view into the business enterprise, financial and management accounting and investment appraisal.

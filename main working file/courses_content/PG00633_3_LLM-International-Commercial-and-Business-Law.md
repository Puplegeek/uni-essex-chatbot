The course covers the ways in which good corporate governance and competitive markets are promoted, as well as how legal and soft law rules and codes regulate:

* Goods and services* Internet activities* Data protection* Consumer protection* The environment

We are ranked 49th for Law in THE World University Rankings by subject 2024, which is 9th in the UK, and we are 3rd in the UK for research power in law (THE research power measure, REF2021).

Our law course will develop your intellectual and critical faculties, encourage you to think independently and teach you to present rational, coherent and accurate arguments orally and in writing. It will provide you with an excellent foundation for any career.

Why we're great.

* Gain relevant industry work experience within an external business or organisation
* Challenge convention and debate governance of commercial and consumer markets
* Develop the critical, analytical and research skills needed for an international law career

### Placement year

LLM International Commercial and Business Law with Professional Placement offers a unique opportunity for you to gain relevant work experience within an external business or organisation, giving you a competitive edge in the job market and providing you with key contacts within the industry. The placement is undertaken between the taught part of the course and the individual project. Its aim is to allow you to acquire industry experience and, especially, develop an appreciation of how the skills acquired in the taught part of the course can be applied to real-world work.

You'll be responsible for securing your own work placement, but if you change your mind and decide not to do your placement, or if you are not able to secure a placement, you can start your dissertation earlier and complete your Masters in the first year.

### Our expert staff

Our internationally diverse community of [staff](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/law/people/academic) and students gives us a breadth of cross-cultural perspectives and insights into law and justice around the world.

This community, combined with opportunities to study abroad during your time with us, ensures you graduate with a genuine worldview and a network of international contacts.

During the year, we hold a careers session for our students in which we reflect upon our own careers and how they have been built as well as those from former students. We are always available to discuss career options and if you are interested in a particular area of the law, we can link you up with the relevant alumni to offer advice.

However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY

Academic Skills in International Law

(15 CREDITS)

This module is a compulsory module for all LLM in International Law students on all pathways, which aims to develop students’ academic skills as required for the postgraduate study of international law. This module has been designed to be taken alongside the module LW902 Public International Law (also compulsory for all LLM in International Law students).
The LW949 Academic Skills in International Law module equips students with the technical skills required to engage in research and study of public international law, including academic referencing of scholarship, treaties, cases of international courts and tribunals. Students also develop the necessary skills to analyse international legal materials, complete both essay and problem-based questions within the field, produce high-quality independent writing at postgraduate level, and reflect upon feedback.
This module will also prepare students for the foundation essay (formative essay) for the LLM in International Law. This is a formative essay, which provides an opportunity for students to engage with postgraduate level reading and writing on a topic of international law, and to submit an essay for the first time at LLM level. As a valuable learning tool, students receive feedback on their foundation essay, allowing them to reflect accordingly for future coursework with a view on how to further develop their skills throughout their postgraduate degree.

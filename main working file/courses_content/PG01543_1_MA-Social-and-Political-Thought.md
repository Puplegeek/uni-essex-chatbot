## Overview

The details

Course: 
Social and Political Thought

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Philosophical, Historical, and Interdisciplinary Studies (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/philosophical-historical-and-interdisciplinary-studies)

We live in a world of social and political upheaval. Faced with multiple crisis – of the environment, of democracy, of war and peace, of poverty among plenty, of facing up to colonialism and structural racism – it is high time to gain better comprehension of our social and political world, and find new solutions. But just as the problems do not come neatly packaged in disciplines, the solutions won't either.

This interdisciplinary MA allows you to draw on Essex's strengths in social and political theory, from critical theory to ideology discourse analysis, from human rights to the sociology of migration, from intergenerational justice to environmental philosophy, from psychoanalytic approaches to theories of justice. Combining compulsory and optional modules from both the humanities and the social sciences, MA Social and Political Thought will equip you to see the world in a new way and to change it for the better.

We are involved in many exciting and interdisciplinary research projects, and have active links with other areas including Political Science, Law, Sociology, Psychoanalysis, and Art History. We are 7th in the UK for research impact in philosophy (Grade Point Average, REF2021).

Why we're great.

* We are world-renowned for our combination of Continental and Anglo-American philosophy
* Tailor your course to focus on continental philosophy, critical social theory, psychoanalysis, or art history
* We are 7th in the UK for research impact in philosophy (Grade Point Average, REF2021)

successfully complete a course at the University of Essex. Where appropriate, we may ask
for specific information relating to previous modules studied or work experience.

## Structure

### Course structure

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The following modules are based on the current course structure and may change in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: COMPULSORY

Dissertation: Social and Political Thought

(80 CREDITS)

This module provides the opportunity for you to undertake a longer independent research project that caps off your MA studies, and, often, is a stepping stone for PhD studies. You will be supported in identifying a suitable topic (and title) by the PGT Director (Philosophy) and the academic staff member who has agreed to act as your supervisor.

[View Dissertation: Social and Political Thought on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PY970&year=25)

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY

Contemporary Political Philosophy

(20 CREDITS)

What is politics (is it about justice or power)? How does political philosophy relate to real politics? What are competing approaches in contemporary philosophy? What are the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches?

[View Contemporary Political Philosophy on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PY413&year=25)

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY

Contemporary Critical Theory

(20 CREDITS)

What is ‘critical theory’? At one level, it is a tradition that can be traced back to ‘Frankfurt School’ thinkers such as Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer. But the term has also come to be used more broadly, to encompass independent traditions of thought such as (certain strands within) feminism, anti-racism, post-colonialism and queer theory. This course aims to give a ‘critical’ introduction to critical theory, looking beyond the canon in order to come to a deeper understanding of critical theory and its limits.

[View Contemporary Critical Theory on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PY948&year=25)

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY

The Frankfurt School

(20 CREDITS)

Discover what is probably the most influential and significant tradition of critical social philosophy to have emerged within twentieth-century European philosophy: The Frankfurt School. The module takes either the form of concentrating on some of the leading figures (such as Adorno and Horkheimer, or Habermas, or Honneth), or focusing on specific themes such as alienation, reification, social pathology, progress, capitalism or social freedom. The exact focus will vary from year to year.

COMPONENT 05: OPTIONAL

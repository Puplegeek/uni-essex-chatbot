## Overview

The details

Course: 
Psychological Wellbeing Practice

Start date: 
February 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Health and Social Care (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care)

Recognition of the personal and social cost of unmet mental health need within primary care has led to a government-supported initiative to broaden access to psychological therapies, introducing the cutting-edge role of psychological well-being practitioners. This brings evidence-based cognitive behavioural treatments to all people who experience mild to moderate depression or anxiety.

You can study Psychological Well-being Practice (PWP) with us at one of two levels. Our [Graduate Certificate](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg00754/2/graduate-certificate-psychological-well-being-practitioner-low-intensity) is relevant for those without an undergraduate degree, who can demonstrate they have the skills to be able to study at level 6, and our Postgraduate Certificate is relevant for those who already have an undergraduate degree. We also offer an apprenticeship route to the Graduate level qualification - find out more about this on our [apprenticeships](https://www.essex.ac.uk/apprenticeships/health-and-social-care-apprenticeships) pages.

Our certificates in PWP enable you to work with people who experience common mental health problems. You will learn to use a range of protocols derived from the best evidence based practice methodologies available. The protocols are drawn from cognitive behavioural theory and utilise self-help processes to empower patients to take control of their own well-being needs.

You will learn the coaching and facilitation skills necessary to support this kind of self-help process and receive a full grounding in the theory underpinning these approaches. You will also learn about the service structure underpinning the IAPT initiative which you will be working in during your training.

The University of Essex has a robust academic tradition and achieves regular high levels of student satisfaction. We continue to work with students, service users and practice partners to continue to improve this established track record.

The School of Health and Social Care is proud to work closely with our Service User Reference Group (SURG). SURG is made up of service users, carers, and volunteers who generously share their first-hand experiences of health and social care. We work collaboratively with SURG to design our courses to ensure that we truly are putting the needs of patients and clients at the heart of what we do. SURG are involved as part of our course application processes and often form part of our interview panels. This helps us to be confident that we are selecting the right applicants for the course and their future careers. SURG members also support the delivery of our teaching sessions and research activity, which means you'll benefit from an insight into their lived experiences of living with a diagnosis, health condition, or circumstance. You'll find that not only does your clinical knowledge expand, but your empathy, compassion and ability to advocate develops also.

**Mandatory Vaccinations**

As you may be aware, the UK government has now revoked legislation that requires all health and social care staff working in sites regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Whilst vaccination is not essential, we encourage our applicants and students to be fully vaccinated. [Find out more about what this means for applicants to this course](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care/undergraduate#vaccination-and-studying-in-our-school).

### Professional accreditation

Accredited by the British Psychological Society (BPS) against the requirements for qualification as a Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner.

Why we're great.

* We give you a solid grounding in cognitive behavioural protocols and treatments, allowing you to utilise self-help processes to empower patients
* We personalise learning and development through small group processes to help you become an effective practitioner
* We work closely with our local IAPT compliant partners to ensure your training prepares you well for your current role in practice and your future career

### Our expert staff

A unique feature of our school is the strong relationship with our practice partners. Our present staff group have all worked in local IAPT compliant services, and have a wealth of experience in both delivering and supervising psychological well-being interventions. The teaching team have qualifications in occupational therapy, counselling, and nursing, and we draw on a broad variety of colleagues from other disciplines to enhance learning experiences.

The team's ability to deliver strongly integrated learning, theory and practice allows genuine personal development and skills acquisition to be grounded in the practice arena.

### Specialist facilities

The School of Health and Social Care is located at two sites; in the Kimmy Eldridge building at our Colchester campus and in the Gateway Building at our Southend campus.

We have purpose-built nursing skills labs at both our Colchester and Southend campuses to meet the needs of a growing and lively School.

### Your future

During your training, it is usual for students to be employed at NHS Band 4 or equivalent. Following training, it is usual for your employing organisation to continue your employment at NHS Band 5 or equivalent. This change in banding acknowledges your qualified status.

PWPs may also go on to achieve senior PWP status and role after gaining further experience. You may also choose to extend your role into one of the new developing areas in IAPT. Some PWPs may become more involved in education of new practitioners. Generally PWPs stay within the role deepening their skills and competencies.

Other career development areas may be available in your particular IAPT services.

We're reactive, we're pioneering, we never stand still, so modules might change from year to year in response to new developments and innovation. Those listed below show how a typical course might look, but more detail on course structure, including details of all optional modules, is available on our [Programme Specification](http://www.essex.ac.uk/programmespecs).

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

Theatre is a radical and influential art form. Its roots lie deep in the ancient world but its relevance to contemporary life is urgent and ongoing. Theatre enables different cultures and societies to confront the most important issues of our time; it provides a crucial space to laugh, to dream, and dare to project different worlds.

Studying theatre and drama at Essex enables you to examine some of the most influential play-texts ever written, and to be ready to take part in shaping the essential performances of tomorrow. This degree is a chance to unlock and explore your creativity. You will be performing and producing work in the professional context of our state-of-the-art Lakeside Theatre, and will be developing a wide range of creative, critical and practical skills that will open the door to a future in the theatre, cultural industries or a wide range of other graduate careers.

At Essex, we offer a rich combination of practical workshops, critical seminars and lectures, and employability opportunities delivered by an experienced team of playwrights, directors, and actors, as well as leading academic theatre specialists.

Areas of exploration in our modules include, but are not limited to:

* Dramatic literature from Ancient Greek tragedy and Shakespeare, to modern plays from around the world
* Contemporary playwriting and devising techniques
* Staging political ideas, human rights and social justice issues
* Gender, identity, orientation and sexual politics on stage
* Creating Applied Theatre in educational and community contexts
* Emergent trends in interactive performance-making and audience participation

Through classroom teaching, practical experiment and professional experience, we help you craft the skillset that will be essential in your creative development. This approach reflects our core belief that engaging with both practice and theory produces a deeper understanding of how theatre works.

We are 9th in UK for drama (The Mail University Guide 2025)

A typical timetable involves a 10-12 hours of teaching every week. This will be a mixture of practical drama workshops and lectures or seminars.

Why we're great.

* We're 8th in UK for drama (The Guardian University Guide 2025).
* As practitioners and industry insiders, we are committed to identifying employment opportunities for our students, and supporting the theatre-makers of the future.

### Study abroad

Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.

Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.

If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university

### Placement year

Maximise the impact of your degree, build your CV and gain invaluable real-world experience. When you arrive at Essex, you can decide whether you would like to combine your course with a placement year.

Undertaking a placement can allow you to gain relevant work experience within an external organisation, giving you a competitive edge in the graduate job market and providing you with key contacts within the cultural industries.

You will be responsible for finding your placement, but with support and guidance provided by both your department and the  [placements team.](mailto:placements@essex.ac.uk)

If you complete a placement year you'll only pay 20% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year.

> > "The atmosphere both on campus and in class was always very friendly and open-minded . . . Having an active theatre on campus really helped me to develop creatively and impacted how I went about making and developing work.  
> >   
> > The course really prepares you for making theatre in every sense . . . I felt like I built up a really amazing skillset which allowed me to develop ideas I had into cohesive pieces of theatre.  
> >   
> > . . . I wholeheartedly believe that without my studying drama at Essex I wouldn’t have ended up working in the theatre industry."

> **BA Drama 2017**
>
> > "The university has a strong multicultural environment . . . Coming from a European background, this diversity was an important factor in my decision.  
> >   
> > Being immersed in such a creatively nurturing environment was incredibly rewarding. The Lakeside Theatre, our own dedicated space, quickly became a second home to me. If I had the chance to do it all over again, I certainly would.  
> >   
> > After graduating, I began my career with an internship at an art gallery, an opportunity made possible through the University of Essex Careers Internships Programme and the foundation provided by my degree. My studies helped me build confidence and acquire a wide range of transferable skills, including analytical thinking, problem-solving, and public speaking, all of which are valuable in any role.  
> >   
> > Theatre encourages a deeper understanding of life and career by exploring human behavior and performance, helping to form a more balanced personal philosophy. This insight continues to guide and grow with me at every stage of my journey."

> ### Grainne Hallahan

> **BA Drama**
>
> > "I adored the library. Plus, the unit on writing your own play. That was an amazing process and I learned so much about writing, editing, and self-scrutiny!  
> >   
> > . . . I learned how to use my voice to engage an audience, and how to read a room of people. Learning about drama is learning about life: it's psychology, sociology, theology, history, language all rolled into one.  
> >   
> > After ten years of teaching, I moved into journalism, and worked at the Times Educational Supplement first as their content writer and then senior analyst.  
> >   
> > I regularly appear on the radio or television to speak about education, and I still use the same breathing techniques and voice projection I learned when I was 18 in the Lakeside Theatre."

> ### Lloyd Shankley
>
> **BA Drama 2017**
>
> > "Academic and Professional Services staff alike were fantastic, always happy to help, and always made me feel like I was worth their time . . .  
> >   
> > . . . We spent three years exploring the human condition, developing new language for our sense of self, nurtured the human capacity for empathy by seeing characters go through the best and worst life has to offer, and learned how the power of storytelling could evoke raw emotion and exorcise deep-rooted issues from its audience.  
> >   
> > I now work in Higher Education, because my lecturers and the professional services staff showed just how excellent working in this sector can be. . . I also occasionally deliver lectures on storytelling and employability skills, for which the ability to perform, think on the spot, make an audience think deeply and then release the intensity with humour has served me well.  
> >   
> > My ability to tell a story has served me well in my work, from application writing, interviews, having difficult conversations, and delivering lectures. . . . I want the next generation of students to get the sense of belonging and educational enrichment I experienced in LiFTS."

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY

Theatre Production and Technology

(15 CREDITS)

Theatre is a collaborative art form. A company of theatre practitioners gathers to make a production, comprising of a producer, director, designers, composers, production manager, performers, technicians, musicians, stage management, promoters, choreographers, scenic artists, set builders etc. according to the needs of the production and the confines of the budget. Each person plays a key role and makes an individual creative contribution to the whole.
In this module, you will develop work related to Technical Theatre Arts. Through hands-on practical workshops, exercises, reflection and seminars this module introduces you to the basic principles of technical theatre, which will be crucial knowledge for use throughout your degree. You work through the basic concepts of lighting, sound, video, stage & production management, along with understanding health & safety in the theatre space.
The conclusion of the module is an assessment that will see you working collaboratively with the goal of staging the technical aspects of a given performance piece on the main stage of Lakeside Theatre.

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY

The Humanities Graduate: Future Pathways

(15 CREDITS)

This interdisciplinary module serves several functions. Firstly, you will develop an understanding of your degree in the context of the wider world and specifically the graduate jobs market. You will come to understand the employability and career-development opportunities that are available to you during and after your time at Essex, and you will begin the life-long process of continuous professional development with a firm grounding in the practical skills and reflective practice involved.
The module is divided into two parts: career-development learning; and Speaker Weeks, when a member of staff will interview guest speakers about their careers in fields that are allied to the arts and humanities. These will cover a range of career areas that may be of interest to humanities graduates in general: from media, arts, journalism, education, publishing, to entrepreneurship in related areas. These weeks are intended to be inspiring but also full of practical tips and ideas, with an emphasis on showing how careers develop over time, and what pathways students can explore to get to where they want to be; as well as what kinds of extra-curricular activities students can engage in now to open more doors professionally before and after graduation.
In the career-development learning part of the module, you will cover topics such as the Graduate Labour market, the Humanities graduate, self-reflection and personal development, and how to research and apply effectively for jobs. Skills such as CV writing and interview technique will be covered. Two-hour interactive lecture/seminars will introduce students to careers resources and ideas, but will also include discussion and group work.

Performing Gender and Identity

(15 CREDITS)

Can theatre make a significant contribution to shifting and impassioned debates about gender, feminism and identity? This module examines how the theatre, from Shakespeare's times to the present day, has explored our inherited scripts of gender, and has challenged how we perform these scripts in life and art. Here we apply gender theory and feminist criticism to examine an exciting range of plays and performance styles, and ask students to make their own piece of theatre in response. This is a module that examines gender from many intersectional perspectives, for anyone curious to understand the many ways perceptions of gender influence identity, image, expression and power.

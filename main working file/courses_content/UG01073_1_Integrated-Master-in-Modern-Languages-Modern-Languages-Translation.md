[Language and Linguistics](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/language-and-linguistics)

**This course is temporarily suspended for academic year 25/26**

Language is fundamental to our thoughts, our relationships, and our civilisations. Through language, we transmit knowledge, from inviting someone for coffee, to promoting the latest scientific theory, to settling global political disputes.

If you're a high achiever with an A-level grade B in a major language, this four-year course is for you. You integrate your undergraduate and postgraduate studies into one course, graduating with an Integrated Masters in Modern Languages in four years, rather than five if the courses are taken separately.

You specialise in at least two modern languages, becoming highly proficient in at least one language. Language study is combined from the third year with translation skills. Your progress will depend on reaching target grades with work expected in the upper 2.1 range.

In your first and second years, you study practical language modules to develop your language skills. French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish can be studied, reaching Proficiency level in the major language by the end of year 2, with Mandarin Chinese taken as an option. These languages are all widely used in the business world and many of our graduates have developed successful global careers with international firms.

Your third year is spent studying abroad with modules taken in language and translation. You carry out research relating to translation for your year abroad project, supported by your supervisor. This independent research project develops your ability to conduct research, work with complex sources of information in your chosen language and employ research methods. You also develop your analytical thinking and problem-solving skills and expand your linguistic and translation skills and communication proficiency in your chosen language. The project is the culmination of both your undergraduate studies and preparation for your final year where you take postgraduate modules.

In addition to the language skills you develop, you explore themes relating to global cultures, history, and politics to gain in-depth knowledge of the countries where the languages you're studying are spoken.

In your final year you return to Essex to study modules in translation and subtitling at postgraduate level.

Why we're great.

* Gain an undergraduate and postgraduate degree in four years, including one year studying abroad.
* 92% of our Department of Language and Linguistics UG graduates are in employment or further study (Graduate Outcomes 2023)
* Gain in-depth cultural, historical and political understanding of the countries you study the languages of.

### Study abroad

Unique to this course is your third year abroad project, which you carry out under supervision from an Essex academic.

During this year, you study abroad at one of the prestigious universities with which we have a link relating to the study of translation, learning your chosen language in a country where the language is spoken. You continue to study translation modules relevant to your course while conducting your own research for a translation studies project.

### Placement year

You can also undertake a placement year abroad in which you will gain real world experience of living and working in another country, fully immersed in its language and culture. You will be responsible for finding your placement, but with support and guidance provided by both your department and our Employability and Careers Centre.

### Our expert staff

[Our lecturers](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/language-and-linguistics/people/academic) are skilled interpreters and translators, experienced in training students with the necessary skills for professional practice. We maintain excellent student-staff ratios with capped language-specific seminars.

  * [Languages for All](https://www.essex.ac.uk/life/for-all/languages-for-all) offers you the opportunity to study an additional language alongside your course at no extra cost

### Your future

Companies and organisations in the UK and abroad are struggling to find university graduates who are fluent in at least one other language, apart from English.

Being an Essex modern languages graduate places you in a very advantageous position. You will be able to speak and write fluently, or to a very competent standard, in up to four languages. Language skills are in scarce supply and can be used in almost any job.

Alongside skills in translation and subtitling, you also gain key employability skills such as researching and writing for specific purposes.

[Our graduates](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/language-and-linguistics/career-prospects) are successful in a wide variety of career paths. They leave Essex with a unique set of skills and experience that are in demand by employers. Some become teachers, translators, administrators and journalists. Their valued language, interpreting and subtitling skills have enabled them to work in diverse fields including banking, entertainment, media, education and tourism, as well as for a host of UK and international companies. In particular, this degree lends itself to a career in education, translation, interpretation, trade, PR, communications, immigration or diplomacy.

We also work with the University's [Student Development Team](http://www.essex.ac.uk/careers) to help you find out about further work experience, internships, placements, and voluntary opportunities.

> "The seminars have been informal and fun, and we’ve been allowed to develop our linguistic ability through several types of assignments and oral examinations. At Essex, I have been particularly impressed by the number of international students and the range of activities available to students. These years will undoubtedly be the best of my life."
>
> Gigi Capone, BA Modern Languages student.
>
> "I loved the combination of all three practices because it provided a lot of variety and expanded my expertise in not one but several linguistic fields. I also found that it struck the perfect balance between theory and practice. My classes focused largely on collaborative learning in small groups which attributed to a dynamic, engaging and interesting learning environment."

However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

In this module, students will be engaged in weekly translation of texts belonging to different domains and genres, such as socio-political, medical, and promotional texts, in order to familiarise themselves with the specific requirements of general and specialised translation.
Students will learn to analyse the source texts at various levels, identify translation challenges and overcome them by applying different strategies and translation techniques.
In line with current translation practices, they will be trained in both direct and inverse translation (B?A and A?B). This will ensure that they are equipped to enter the translation market and have an edge over their competitors. They will also be fully prepared to work both at home and in B-language countries.

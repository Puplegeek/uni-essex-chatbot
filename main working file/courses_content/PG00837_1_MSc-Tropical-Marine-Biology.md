Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Life Sciences (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/biological-sciences)

Coral reefs are the most species-rich marine habitats, and also among the most threatened. Rapid global change has the potential to cause significant harm to these unique ecosystems and impact the local and global resources they provide.

By studying MSc Tropical Marine Biology in our [School of Life Sciences](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences) you enjoy a unique training experience designed to provide you with the specific tools to study and protect fragile marine systems.

Our multidisciplinary course is delivered entirely by research-active academics who are among the leaders of their respective disciplines. Advanced theory in tropical marine biology is complemented by practical skills training in quantitative methods, data analytics, field survey techniques, and a comprehensive range of the practical and professional skills required by today's employers.

During a field trip to Indonesia, you can put theory into practice by studying coral reef conservation in action (subsidised, with a variable element to be paid by the student). Or,we can help you to identify your ideal work placement or equivalent project in the UK.

Our MSc Tropical Marine Biology course introduces you to the unique resources found in tropical oceans through a range of modules.

* The biotechnological ‘treasure chest' of marine microbes, algae and invertebrates. What processes underpin a healthy marine ecosystem? How can we use microbes to clean up pollution and make new eco-friendly materials from aquaculture waste?* Quantitative analysis of ecological processes in the tropical oceans, from seagrass beds and mangroves to coral reefs and artificial communities growing on man-made structures. How do you measure and compare populations and communities?* Coral reef resource management and conservation. How can local communities protect coral reefs while practising traditional activities and sustainably harvesting food?

In addition to taught modules covering these topics and more, you embark on an extensive research project under the supervision of an expert at the forefront of their field. You will have the freedom to choose the subject of your project, which can be conducted in-field, within our new aquatic biology research facility, in a working academic research laboratory on campus, or alongside one of our research partners across the globe. This is your chance to develop the specific experience that you need to go into employment, whether that is to generate ecological survey data, prospect for pharmaceuticals, practise data analytics, GIS mapping, or direct environmental policy.

We’re ranked 54th (14th in UK) for promoting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal for climate action (Times Higher Education Impact Rankings 2024).

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

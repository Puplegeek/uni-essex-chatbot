UCAS code: 
C89C

Start date:

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
4 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Essex Pathways](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-pathways)

Our BA Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies (including Foundation Year) could be suitable for you if your academic qualifications do not yet meet our entry requirements for a three-year version of our social sciences courses and you want a programme that improves your skills to support your academic performance.

Open to UK and EU applicants, this four-year course includes a Foundation Year (known as Year Zero) which is delivered by our [Essex Pathways Department](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-pathways) followed by a further three years of study in our [Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychosocial-and-psychoanalytic-studies)

During Year Zero you will study on our [Social Sciences Pathway](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-pathways/foundation-year/social-sciences) which will cover topics such as Analysing the Social and Political World, and People and Society. At the end of Year Zero all students who pass the Social Sciences Pathway will have a choice of which course to progress with. As well as BA Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies (PPS), students on the Social Sciences Pathway could also study BA Childhood Studies or BA Sociology, amongst other courses.

From year one you will continue developing your academic skills alongside discovering the different schools of psychoanalysis and explore its applications to different settings and objects of study - from individual clinical work, to groups, culture and society. At its core, psychoanalysis believes that understanding human experience is not just about looking at external factors, from the places we live and work to the people we talk to, but also at internal ones - our inner motivations, fantasies, and defence mechanisms, to name a few.

Beginning with an introduction to psychodynamic concepts as applied to individuals, relationships and organisations, BA PPS goes on to provide a comprehensive account of child and adult development and critical overviews of both Freudian and Jungian psychology. From this foundation, psychodynamic approaches are then applied thematically to diverse areas including:

* The psychological factors that influence our emotions, behaviours and relationships* The forces that drive human behaviour and interaction* Literature and film* War and trauma* Sexuality

Why we're great.

* We offer you a unique opportunity to study psychoanalytic and psychosocial ideas and their applications with lecturers who are leading researchers and clinicians in their fields.
* Our course has been repeatedly commended for delivering inspiring content and achieving spectacular academic results.
* Our graduates go on to pursue exciting careers in many diverse fields including in the national and international charity sectors, policy and social work, clinical settings, as well as pursuing further academic research.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course.Â A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules fromÂ which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The Psychosocial Imagination

(30 CREDITS)

This introductory, two-term module foregrounds the â€˜psychosocialâ€™ in the BA in Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies. Whilst deeply rooted in a range of theoretical ideas, the module will be selective in its treatment of the psychosocial, and illustrative of further areas of study to come at later points in the degree.
The moduleâ€™s main point of emphasis will be on â€˜imaginationâ€™, in a dual sense. Both how we might imagine the â€˜psychosocialâ€™ as a discipline, with its specific forms of knowledge, theoretical frames and domains of application, but also in the sense that psychosocial studies might give weight to forms of imagination and representation in their capacity to link subjective and embodied existence with social life.

Lacanian psychoanalysis

(15 CREDITS)

This module explores the work of French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. Lacan made links between psychoanalysis and linguistics, anthropology, literature and philosophy.

Care, Intimacy, Vulnerability: an Introduction to Psychosocial Theory

(15 CREDITS)

This second-year undergraduate module provides a grounding in theories of the psychosocial with a special focus on care, dependence, intimacy, and vulnerability. It enables you to critically engage with a range of theoretical approaches from psychoanalysis, sociology, critical theory, postcolonial and decolonial theory. Using â€˜care, intimacy and vulnerabilityâ€™ as its main pillars encourages you to reflect on practices of care, being card for and caring for others, as well as how these phenomena intersect with social and clinical processes. The module encourages you to engage with academic debates in a robust way and strengthen your reflexivity by enabling you to explore your own lived experiences of care. It is suitable for you wishing to work with people in various professional roles such as psychotherapy and mental health, social policy and research, human resources, education, and management. The module tallies with the Universityâ€™s ongoing commitment to tackling the under-representation of ethnic minority groups and follows the principles of a decolonial curriculum by incorporating scholarship from BAME scholars. Finally, in building a solid, decolonial curriculum, the module also promotes greater visibility and inclusion for BAME students.
You may find some of the readings included in this curriculum challenging. Whenever possible readings from non-scholarly sources are included to enable you to engage with ideas written in more accessible ways. The readings will be discussed in the lecture and seminars. You are encouraged to engage with the readings as much as you can manage.
Questions considered include:
1. What is care? What is intimacy? Are care and intimacy central to cultivating strong interpersonal relationships?
2. What circumstances and structures â€“ social, political, and personal â€“ enable the emergence of caring relationships?
3. In what ways and to what extent does care play a crucial role in the organisation of socio-cultural and psychic life?
4. At a time of increasing alienation and loneliness, how can we reclaim meaningful, intimate relationships?

Current Debates in Psychosocial Studies

Members of staff from the Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies will use aspects of their research to open up debates in depth psychology and psychosocial studies. These may touch on issues of continuing importance for the contemporary discipline, or newly emerging questions. The content will vary from year to year so as to remain innovative and attuned to what is most recent in the field, but may include topics such as gender and intimacy, clinical cases, racism and neuro-psychoanalysis.

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY

Madness and its Cure

(15 CREDITS)

Why do we treat mental health disorders? Is it purely to reduce distress, or is something more complicated going on? Can treatments for mental ill health be interpreted as enforcement or oppression? Alternatively, what happens when therapy is only available to those with socio-economic privilege? Through a critical interrogation of the idea of the â€˜cureâ€™, this module poses a question concerning the treatment of mental health disorders and models of recovery.
The module will explore the spaces in which treatment has been situated, ranging from the asylum to the clinic, to the community. Students will be encouraged to think about the political, ethical, and economic implications of different models of â€˜cureâ€™ including psychoanalysis and psychiatry. Students will gain an understanding of the history of mental health discourse from the 19th century to the present day, as well as thinking about the current crisis in mental health provision in the UK.

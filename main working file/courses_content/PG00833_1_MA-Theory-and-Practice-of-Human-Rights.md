Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Essex Law School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/law)

Our [Human Rights Centre](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/human-rights) is one of the world's oldest and most highly-respected environments for the multi-disciplinary study of human rights. Studying human rights at Essex will enable you to become a member of one of the world's largest, most culturally diverse and professionally successful community of human rights students, practitioners and academics.

Our interdisciplinary course, MA Theory and Practice of Human Rights, examines the history, theoretical development and implementation of human rights. Beyond the practical problems of human rights lie many unresolved theoretical and philosophical issues. These form the basis of this course, which provides you with a solid grounding in fundamental human rights matters within:

* Law* Politics* Philosophy* Sociology

You do not need a Law or Human Rights based undergraduate degree to apply for this MA. We consider applicants for entry to this course with an undergraduate degree in Humanities or Social Sciences. Studying this course will enable you to undertake practical or legal work for human rights organisations.

Our students now have the opportunity to opt for one of four distinct pathways. This includes a generic pathway in which students can choose optional modules spanning across many academic disciplines.

For those students who have a more specific interest in specialising in a distinct area of human rights, we have created the following pathways:

* Human rights, global diversity and global challenges* Human rights, social justice and social change* Human rights, gender, race and identity.* Human rights and the arts - *we offer the only MA in the UK that combines arts and human rights, that doesn't require a Law undergraduate degree*

To learn more about our pathways, visit the structure tab, or  [read a blog by Dr Andrew Fagan, Director of the Human Rights Centre.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/blog/student/posts/2022/01/11/ma-theory-and-practice-of-human-rights-pathways)

Our interdisciplinary Human Rights Centre is the UK's leading centre for the study of the theory and practice of international human rights, and has a worldwide reputation for research, teaching and practice. In February 2010, we were awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize in recognition of our work in advancing human rights across the globe.

At Essex, we specialise in [business law](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/law/research/business-law), [public law](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/law/research/public-law), [criminal justice](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/law/research/criminal-justice), [health law](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/law/research/health-law), [law and technology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/law/research/law-and-technology), [socio-legal studies](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/law/research/socio-legal-studies) and [human rights law](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/law/research/human-rights).

We are ranked 49th for Law in THE World University Rankings by subject 2024, which is 9th in the UK, and we are 3rd in the UK for research power in law (THE research power measure, REF2021).

This course is also available on a part-time basis.

Why we're great.

* Work for professional practical or legal human right organisations after graduation
* We offer 4 distinct pathways allowing you to specialise depending on your human rights interests
* We are 3rd in the UK for research power in law (THE research power measure, REF2021)

### English language requirements

  

If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 6.5 overall with a minimum
component score of 6.0 in writing and 5.5 in all other components.

If you do not meet our IELTS requirements then you may be able to complete a [pre-sessional English
pathway](https://www.essex.ac.uk/international/pre-sessional/) that enables you to start your course without retaking IELTS.

### Additional Notes

The University uses academic selection criteria to determine an applicant’s ability to
successfully complete a course at the University of Essex. Where appropriate, we may ask
for specific information relating to previous modules studied or work experience.

## Structure

### Course structure

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The following modules are based on the current course structure and may change in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.

Our students now have the opportunity to opt for one of four distinct pathways. This includes a generic pathway in which students can choose optional modules spanning across many academic disciplines. For those students who have a more specific interest in specialising in a distinct area of human rights, we have created the following pathways: human rights, global diversity and global challenges; human rights, social justice and social change; and finally, human rights, gender, race and identity.

1. Generic pathway

This pathway allows our students the opportunity to acquire a broad, generalist education in human rights without specialising on a specific set of themes and issues. The content of the generic pathway encompasses the vast range of optional modules available across all of the other MA Theory and Practice of Human Rights pathways.

2. Human Rights, Global Diversity and Global Challenges

This pathway offers students the opportunity to engage with a comprehensive set of normative and institutional challenges surrounding the complex relationship between the promotion of universal human rights and respecting regional, national and cultural differences. It also offers an opportunity to engage with principal regional approaches to international human rights law and to contextualise these within a global framework which continues to be deeply influenced by a variety of complex power relationships between, for example, the Global North and Global South. This pathway is great for students who wish to develop human rights careers in a changing global landscape, in which new challenges are emerging.

3. Human Rights, Social Justice & Social Change

Human rights are widely perceived as an integral component of wider attempts to promote social justice. To this extent, the complex relationship between normative theories of justice and key political, legal, social and economic institutions ought to be a core focal point for the study of human rights. Similarly, there are many sources of and factors within a broad array of forms of continuing injustice. It is essential that these factors are effectively understood and engaged with. Finally, all political, social legal and economic forms of life are subject to significant forms of change and alteration, which often have a profound impact upon our understanding and application of human rights. This pathway provides an opportunity for students to engage with this crucial area of academic and practical interest. This pathway is for students who are interested in political/social theory, focused upon combatting socio-economic injustices and inequalities, and those with more overtly practical motivations towards learning how to deploy human rights in the current global order.

4. Human Rights, Gender, Race & Identity

This pathway will examine the role of human rights in recognising, protecting and advocating for marginalised groups or identities – those at the social fringes who find it difficult access sites of power - the economy, politics, the enjoyment of rights & social capital on account of group membership. Linking to theories of social justice and social change, the pathway will introduce students to different paradigms from a range of disciplines to enable them to conceptualise ways (both theoretical and practical) to redress social imbalances between dominant and marginal groups (for example, how to address structural and institutional racism, how to address the economic, social, institutional and cultural effects of patriarchy, or how to address extreme income and wealth inequalities between groups), leading to fairer and more equitable societies.

5. Human Rights and the Arts

*We offer the only MA in the UK that combines arts and human rights, that doesn't require a Law undergraduate degree*

This pathway will provide students with an interdisciplinary introduction to and engagement with the relationship between human rights and the arts. Separate sessions will focus upon the specific contributions which a carefully selected range of artistic forms and genres have engaged with and contributed to the global defence of human rights. The pathway is taught by and will draw upon the expertise of colleagues in the areas of contemporary art, cultural studies, dance, literature, mass media and photography. It will enable students to situate key debates surrounding the significance and importance of art within wider human rights challenges. Key topics will include, photography and human rights, the art of protest movements and Holocaust and art restitution.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

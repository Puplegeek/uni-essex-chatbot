Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: CORE

Research Project

(60 CREDITS)

The research project module is an opportunity for you to carry out an individual scientific investigation on a topic relating to your degree specialisation. It will help develop your skills in reviewing synthesising and critically appraising academic literature. You will also be expected to design, analyse and interpret data and present findings in a scientific paper format.

[View Research Project on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=SE740&year=25)

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY

Planning and Implementation of the Training Process

(30 CREDITS)

This module will present to students, through a wide range of theoretical, empirical and practical evidence, methods that can be used to design, monitor and implement techniques to optimally structure athletes' training activities.
The module will outline a variety of programming approaches related to such issues as athletes' needs analyses, training periodisation and the application of a multitude of different training types. Students will develop their ability to critically analyse the wide range of techniques that they can apply to athletes operating in a variety of different contexts.

[View Planning and Implementation of the Training Process on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=SE793&year=25)

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY

Neuromechanical basis of strength and conditioning

(15 CREDITS)

Strength and conditioning coaches deal primarily with movement problems – problems that ultimately impede the expression of force.
The primary task of a strength and conditioning coach is to optimise an athlete's movement performance whilst minimising the risk of injury/pain. The art of coaching, which you will learn in other modules, must be informed by the scientific basis underpinning movement and its control. The aim of this module is to equip you with the theoretical and practical movement-based skills that will optimise your ability to assess, plan, and implement strength training programs to improve athletic performance.

[View Neuromechanical basis of strength and conditioning on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=SE788&year=25)

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY

Skill Acquisition: Theory and Application

(15 CREDITS)

Skill acquisition is commonly described as the voluntary control over movements in an attempt to solve motor skill problems and achieve a task goal.
These may vary from catching a ball or riding a bike, to slalom skiing or rhythmic gymnastics. Regardless of the domain, the interaction between the practitioner (e.g., coach) and athlete when learning these skills is absolutely fundamental to successful performance. Specifically, how can the practitioner create optimal practice conditions to facilitate skill acquisition? The module will firstly enhance your understanding of contemporary theory and research in skill learning and motor expertise. From this, the module takes on a more applied focus, where evidence-based approaches are synthesised to critically evaluate their effect on coaching practice.

[View Skill Acquisition: Theory and Application on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=SE789&year=25)

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY

Physiology of Training

(15 CREDITS)

The Physiology of Training module aims to give students an understanding of the physiological mechanism that underpin human performance.
The module will develop the student's critical knowledge around the physiological demands of short explosive, long sustained and intermittent activities from the perspective of different energy systems. Students will also gain and understanding of performing laboratory and field-based tests to physiologically profile athletes.

[View Physiology of Training on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=SE790&year=25)

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY

Critical Enquiry and Evidence-Based Practice

(15 CREDITS)

This module will give students the opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of the complexities in critically evaluating study design, analysis and interpretation of research studies.
The module will cover the practical usage and critical analysis of different research methodologies in traditional research setting and within an applied environment.

[View Critical Enquiry and Evidence-Based Practice on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=SE792&year=25)

COMPONENT 07: COMPULSORY

Techniques in Strength and Conditioning

(15 CREDITS)

This module will introduce students to the underpinning practical skills required for the delivery of Strength and Conditioning services to athletes.
The module will focus on developing students' awareness and understanding of a variety of exercise technical models that will support their ability to improve an athlete's performance. This will include developing students reasoning skills around why elements of performance for each exercise are vital. Students will also gain experience with a wide range of exercise equipment to further their practice as a Strength and Conditioning professional.

[View Techniques in Strength and Conditioning on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=SE787&year=25)

COMPONENT 08: COMPULSORY

Professional Development in Strength and Conditioning

(15 CREDITS)

This module provides the opportunity to gain hands-on experience working as a coach or practitioner to develop students underpinning knowledge of key applied practice in strength and conditioning.
This module centres on professional development through mentorship, where students will be supported by professionals working in strength and conditioning to develop specialised skills. The module will shine a light on various aspects of strength and conditioning to better equip students with insider knowledge of various aspects and contexts within sport. Students are encouraged to adopt a reflective approach to develop their expertise and practice.

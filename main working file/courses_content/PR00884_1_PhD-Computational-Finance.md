[Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering)

We offer research supervision for our PhD Computational Finance in the following fields:

* agent-based modelling of financial markets* computational risk management* high-frequency finance* the use of computational-intelligence methods for investment decision making

We provide a vibrant research environment so our PhD students publish papers in prestigious international conferences and often attract the attention of industry and government. A recent PhD student was invited to present their research on term structure models to the Bank of England, and many others get the opportunity to directly apply their research through internships at investment banks and hedge funds.

Our graduates have gone on to become quantitative analysts, portfolio managers and software engineers at various institutions, including major investment banks like HSBC and Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.

You can start this degree in October, January or April, either full-time or part-time. We also offer an MPhil and MSD in this area.

Why we're great.

* We have an international reputation for leading, interdisciplinary work combining economic and financial modelling with computational implementation.
* Our research is geared towards practical applications, and many of our academic staff have experience applying their findings in industry and in advising the UK government.
* We are supported by Essex's highly-rated Department of Economics, School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, and Essex Business School.

### Our expert staff

Within our [Centre for Computational Finance and Economic Agents](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/computational-finance-and-economic-agents) (CCFEA), PhD students are typically jointly supervised by academic staff in two of our constituent departments, to give you an interdisciplinary perspective on your topic of research.

Sorry, the entry requirements for the country that you have selected are not available here. Please contact our Graduate Admissions team at [pgquery@essex.ac.uk](mailto:pgquery@essex.ac.uk) to request the entry requirements for this country.

### English language requirements

If English is not your first language, then we will require you to have IELTS 6.0 with a minimum of 5.5 in each component

## Structure

### Course structure

A research degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

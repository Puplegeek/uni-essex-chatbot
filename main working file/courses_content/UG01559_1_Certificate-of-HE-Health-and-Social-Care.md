Health and Social Care

UCAS code: 
L518

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location:

Based in: 
[Health and Social Care (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care)

Improving the physical, social or emotional lives of adults can take place in charities, homes or creative environments. This programme is an excellent opportunity for new students to gain vital skills and the adaptability to enter the changing UK workforce. It has also been designed in line with [The Care Certificate](https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Developing-your-workforce/Care-Certificate/Care-Certificate.aspx), an agreed set of standards expected of support worker roles in the health and social care sectors.

Our lecturers believe that administering high-quality care begins with the empathy and kindness of the practitioner, and this course is ideal for anyone who is conscientious and eager to receive realistic practice in patient care. You will be able to learn through flexible and social teaching to guide you from the start of your journey to becoming competent and confident to apply for further education or to roles in the sector.

If you're new to health care (or are in work), you will gradually receive simulated learning experiences, lectures and seminars on campus so that when you are caring for individuals in need – you are familiar with equipment, potential hazards and will feel informed to make life-saving decisions.

The opportunity to train in workshops without the real consequences of errors with vulnerable patients will enable you to deliver better support, communication and kindness when you do begin to practice in varying locations across the UK and beyond.

#### Location

This course is taught at both our Colchester and Southend campuses.

### Professional accreditation

Approved by the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE) as a Higher Technical Qualification (HTQ). IfATE work with employers to develop and approve apprenticeships and technical qualifications. IfATE approves CertHE Health & Social Care as a HTQ aligned to the Lead Practitioner in Adult Care standard (ST0007). This means that the course has been developed in collaboration with employers so that students can develop the skills that are needed in the workplace.

Why we're great.

* You will be provided realistic practice for developing your proficiency in patient care, through consistent simulation scenarios throughout the programme.
* Lectures will be taught by staff from varied health and social care backgrounds from within the School of Health and Social Care, including Nursing, Speech & Language Therapy, Occupational Therapy and Social Work.
* We have state-of-the-art teaching facilities including mock wards at both campuses.

### Our expert staff

Lectures will be taught by staff from varied health and social care backgrounds from within the School of Health and Social Care, including Nursing, Speech & Language Therapy, Occupational Therapy and Social Work. Staff will introduce theoretical and conceptual material associated with their professional backgrounds but will also deliver material that is interprofessional and advocates the concept of health and social care as a multidisciplinary effort.

### Specialist facilities

We have purpose-built nursing skills labs at both our Colchester and Southend campuses to meet the needs of a growing and lively School. We offer excellent physical and online resources in terms of libraries, computer labs, data-sets, archives and other research materials.

Our dedicated support tutor will help to develop your academic literacy and clinical numeracy skills. This helps you apply these critically important areas of study to real life situations.

## Structure

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

### Teaching

CertHE students will be given extensive simulated learning opportunities to develop the knowledge and skills required for these roles, giving students an understanding of complex nature of working in health and social care settings in a safe and controlled environment. This will be facilitated by a range of health and social care professionals, giving students insight into a broad range of practices, approaches and further study opportunities.

On this programme you will usually spend 2 days per week on campus, including one day per week spent in our mock wards where you will develop your clinical skills.

### Assessment

Learning outcomes are not seen by teaching staff as the threshold for obtaining a pass but are seen as baseline standards that students require to develop on their journey to becoming lifelong learners.

The assessment methods will ensure that different students' learning needs and preferences are met, regardless of their backgrounds, learning styles or abilities. This will include considering feedback timing and ensuring that assessment briefs are easily accessible to all students.

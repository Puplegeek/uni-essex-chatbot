**This course has been temporarily suspended for the academic year 2025-26.**

Change is inevitable. Change within organisations, however, is often complex and influenced by external factors that play an important role in how change is planned, communicated and ultimately operationalised.

MSc Organisational Change Management is a specialist course, which will prepare you for a role in organisational management or consultancy. The course will introduce you to advanced research in change management and will allow you to approach organisational change management from both a commercial and a social perspective, in order to help you understand not only why change happens, but how to manage it.

This course is perfect if you have a first degree in business management, or in a related subject area, or have relevant work experience in organisational management. MSc Organisational Change Management will help you to enter or progress within the job market with a deeper understanding of management and organisational change.

You will graduate with an ability to excel in a management career and with the capacity to shape organisations and organisational life for the better.

Topics you will study include:

* organisational behaviour and human resource management* understanding organisational change* change, creativity and innovation* leading change* ethics and corporate social responsibility (CSR)* equality and diversity

MSc Organisational Change Management is taught at [Essex Business School.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-business-school). We don't just think about business as being a collection of equipment, buildings and stock, instead we consider a business to be an interconnected group of people. People who have the power to influence, and be influenced by, the operations of that business. This approach to understanding the human aspects of why businesses operate in the way they do lends itself perfectly to a course focussed on how and why change happens within organisations.

Why we're great.

* Our academics are involved in change management projects for major national organisations, such as the NHS, and bring this experience into your teaching.
* Become an expert in an increasingly essential field, as organisations search for graduates who can implement change.
* Become a member of our thriving Centre for Work, Organisation and Society (CWOS) that supports the research of our world-leading academics.

### Our expert staff

Essex Business School has an international reputation for research on workplace inequalities and injustices. Research by our organisation studies and human resource management group covers:

* job insecurity and its consequences across cultures
* organisational change, transition and leadership
* sustainability, ethics and corporate social responsibility
* integrated health care, workplace wellbeing and mental health
* collective creativity and innovation
* emotional and aesthetic aspects of work and workplaces

You'll have the opportunity to hear from experts such as [Dr Danielle Tucker](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/TUCKE64400/Danielle-Tucker), Reader, in Organisation Studies and Human Resource Management at Essex Business School.

Dr Tucker is an expert in public sector organisational change and has recently returned from a British Academy Innovation Fellowship where she worked with a change management consultancy company to develop a digital toolkit to support the recruitment, learning and development of change agents within organisations.

Her work investigates how change communication and key change managers influence the flow of information and ideas across organisational and divisional boundaries, to help us understand partnership working and collaboration arrangements in achieving system level change. Her research is regularly published in journals such as Human Relations, Journal of Business Ethics, and she is the co-author of a leading textbook on Organizational Change Management: Inclusion, Collaboration and Digital Change in Practice, along with Dr Stefano Cirella and Dr Paul Kelly who also contribute to this programme.

Dr Tucker is regularly invited to consult and support for public sector organisations (including Police, Local Authority, Local Government, NHS Trusts and health and social care providers), helping them to plan for and evaluate complex change management initiatives and understand the impact of the change on their employees and stakeholders.

The research activities of academics in our organisation studies and human resource management group is supported by the [Centre for Work, Organisation and Society (CWOS)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/work-organisation-and-society) which brings together interdisciplinary research on work, society and organisational life. The Centre's research draws on the humanities and social sciences, bringing in perspectives from disciplines such as cultural studies, history, literary theory, philosophy, psychology, sociology and political economy.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: CORE WITH OPTIONS

Applied Project

(60 CREDITS)

For your dissertation, you produce an extended, independent, piece of work based on a live organisational case study. You undertake a thorough review of literature and current knowledge and diagnose a real people management and development issue. The dissertation will demonstrate your ability to synthesise theories, relate them to practice in a critical manner and to make practical recommendations for change. You’re assigned a supervisor for the duration of your project.

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY

Understanding Organisational Change

(10 CREDITS)

This module encourages you to reflect upon the nature of change in organisations and consider many of the key aspects in preparing for, implementing, and evaluating a variety of types and aspects of organisational changes.
Building upon key theories and debates you will explore the process and consequences of introducing change in organisations while recognising the complexity inherent in changing organisations.
The emphasis of the module is to develop the analytical skills to understand the broad principles underlying the key stages in a change process that could be then applied to a range of different types of changes within organisations. The course is not driven by providing recipes but more by realising the value of critical analytical and reasoning skills that can be applied to the practicalities of different organisational change interventions.

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY

Organisational Behaviour and Human Resource Management

(20 CREDITS)

This module is designed to encourage students to think and reflect upon the nature of managing people and organisations. In particular, it encourages students to consider the main topics of Organisational Behaviour and Human Resource Management. Throughout the sessions, the core issues affecting organisational behaviour and outcomes will be discussed and critically analysed. Therefore, it invites participants to consider the tensions emerging from competing views and perspectives. In so doing, the module challenges many of the taken-for-granted assumptions about people management, and provides tools to analyse organisations and to explore the realities of organisational life.

Law affects every aspect of our lives: from our relationships with other people, to our interactions with shops, banks, companies and governments. Studying law enables you to understand how societies are regulated and how you can change it.

Our LLB Law (Senior Status) is designed for those with an existing degree in any discipline and provides a comprehensive training in law over a concentrated two-year period.

At Essex we teach the law that matters, with a concern for the demands of justice and commerce. We combine a rigorous legal training with opportunities for developing your practical expertise, and you learn to analyse the law of England and Wales in relation to its European and international frameworks and to apply it in practice.

As a law student, not only will you learn legal rules, but you will also consider the function of law in society, the philosophy of law, policy issues and law reform. You cover all the key areas of law including:

* Property law, land law, equity and trusts* Law of the European Union* Contract law and tort law* Criminal law* Public law

We are ranked 49th for Law in THE World University Rankings by subject 2024, which is 9th in the UK.

At Essex, we don't simply prepare you to for the legal profession. We equip you with the skills and knowledge to become an agent for change, whatever career path you choose.

Why we're great.

Over the first two years, alongside law subjects, you will take a career management module designed to help you identify personal strengths and goals, understand what employers (both within and outside law) are looking for and enhance your employability profile.

We also hold an annual law fair, attended by law firms and vocational qualification providers. Our graduates pursue careers in the law and in a wide range of other sectors including business and commerce, accountancy, insurance, banking, central and local government, academia, teaching, social work and the police force.

> “My current position within the Treasury Solicitor’s Department is extremely challenging, and I’m glad that I gained such a solid understanding of public and human rights law; but a degree alone wouldn’t have guaranteed me such an amazing job. Opportunities such as the University of Essex Law Clinic also really helped me stand out from the crowd.”

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

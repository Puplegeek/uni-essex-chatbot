October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration:

The LLM in Law and Technology at Essex Law School gives you the opportunity to analyse the impact of modern technologies on the application of traditional legal principles and the ways in which challenges raised by modern technologies could and should be addressed by the law. You will gain an understanding of how modern technologies impact the law and the society around us, and you will be able to select a range of modules that incorporate aspects of technology enabling you to effectively specialise in commercial or human rights law along with having a course in law and technology.

This course will give you specialised knowledge that is invaluable in our technology driven society. While opening up a wide range of career opportunities, such as in technology companies, or as a legal technologist, as well as within traditional law firms, corporations, or NGOs who are looking to hire a technology native lawyer or as technology policy advisor.

Why we're great.

* Choose from optional modules to develop extensive knowledge in the areas that interest you the most.
* University of Essex is 15th for international outlook in the world (the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2023)
* The course will develop your intellectual curiosity and critical thinking, encourage you to think independently and teach you to present rational, coherent and accurate arguments orally and in writing.

### Your future

### English language requirements

  

If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 6.5 overall with a minimum
component score of 6.0 in writing and 5.5 in all other components.

If you do not meet our IELTS requirements then you may be able to complete a [pre-sessional English
pathway](https://www.essex.ac.uk/international/pre-sessional/) that enables you to start your course without retaking IELTS.

### Additional Notes

The University uses academic selection criteria to determine an applicant’s ability to
successfully complete a course at the University of Essex. Where appropriate, we may ask
for specific information relating to previous modules studied or work experience.

## Structure

### Course structure

We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of core/compulsory modules, and optional modules chosen from lists.

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY

Digital Technologies, Law and Society

(15 CREDITS)

How do digital technologies and their regulation impact on society? We are currently living in a “digital society”. It suffices to think about our daily private communications, the electronic systems often used to book public services, the facial recognition systems used to control States’ borders or the blockchain technology employed to conclude and perform contracts. All these activities are carried out via digital systems. These new technologies have prompted a new wave of regulation concerning data management, online platforms, artificial intelligence, and algorithms. However, not all societal areas impacted by technologies are currently governed through sector-specific regulation, leaving several questions on adapting pre-existing frameworks and whether new ad-hoc rules are required.

(70 CREDITS)

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY

Foundation Essay

(0 CREDITS)

The Foundation Essay is a diagnostic essay intended to provide an early opportunity to engage in legal analysis and writing. It is designed to provide students with an opportunity to learn and demonstrate independent learning, legal writing, research, methodologies and analysis, necessary for postgraduate study. The Foundation Essay is also a formative exercise for modules in the LLM courses. The mark for the essay does not count towards the final assessment of the degree, but it is a compulsory piece of work.

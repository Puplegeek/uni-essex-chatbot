Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

COMPONENT 04: CORE

Dissertation

(30 CREDITS)

n this module students will devise and plan a performance project (national / international tour; a festival; a feature film) in the media of your choice. As this is a theoretical project, students will not be required to realise the plan in practical terms, and as such provide the widest possible scope for their creative ambitions. Nonetheless, artistic concepts (script, design, wardrobe, etc.) and the practicalities of running the project (costing, venues, staging, casting and production schedules, etc.)need to be researched and presented in detail. This will require students to utilise the core skills and knowledge that were developed during the first and second year, use various forms of research, and demonstrate both oral and written expression of ideas.

### Teaching

##### Year 1

The first year of this course focuses on the fundamental elements of producing theatre and film to build the foundations of knowledge and skills that you will need to progress to more creative modules in years 2 and 3. Throughout the year you will:

* Gain an understanding of lighting and sound for performance
* Discover how to turn an artistic endeavour into a feasible, marketable product
* Work behind the camera to make short videos that can exist on their own as a narrative or support larger work as marketing material

Although this is a largely practical course, you will also develop requisite research skills required for the working world and understand the historical and cultural context to arts practice

##### Year 2

Throughout this year, you will further develop your new skills and learn new facets of the producing role by focusing on more specific tasks across media, theatre and film production. You will also:

* Develop your understanding of the skills required to write for film
* Develop your understanding of location management, fundraising, preparing grant proposals, touring a production, and filming live events
* Explore the role and practice of the director and dramaturg in theatre and film

##### Year 3

Your final year consists of one core unit, a written proposal, in which you plan a project that you could feasibly achieve in the future.

Alongside this, there are opportunities to practically engage with vocational pathways, for example, film production, theatre producing, writing for screen or performance, etc.

### Virtual tours

If you live too far away to come to Essex (or have a busy lifestyle), no problem. Our 360 degree virtual tours allows you to explore our University from the comfort of your home. Check out our [Colchester virtual tour](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/virtual-tours/colchester) and [Southend virtual tour](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/virtual-tours/southend) to see accommodation options, facilities and social spaces.

At Essex we pride ourselves on being a welcoming and inclusive student community. We offer a [wide range of support](https://www.essex.ac.uk/student/equality-and-diversity) to individuals and groups of student members who may have specific requirements, interests or responsibilities.

*The University makes every effort to ensure that this information on its programme specification is accurate and up-to-date. Exceptionally it can be necessary to make changes, for example to courses, facilities or fees. Examples of such reasons might include, but are not limited to: strikes, other industrial action, staff illness, severe weather, fire, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack (whether declared or not), natural disaster, restrictions imposed by government or public authorities, epidemic or pandemic disease, failure of public utilities or transport systems or the withdrawal/reduction of funding. Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our [programme specifications](http://www.essex.ac.uk/programmespecs/). The University would inform and engage with you if your course was to be discontinued, and would provide you with options, where appropriate, in line with our Compensation and Refund Policy.*

*The full Procedures, Rules and Regulations of the University governing how it operates are set out in the Charter, Statutes and
Ordinances and in the University Regulations, Policy and Procedures.*

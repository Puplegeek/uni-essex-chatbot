[Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science)

Mathematics at Essex is not what you would expect and has a genuinely broad reach; from exploring the economic impact of the social networks of cows, to the mathematical modelling of brain evolution to improve patient care – our research explores issues of global importance.

Mathematics is the language that underpins the rest of science. Our interdisciplinary research recognises that mathematics, including what can be very abstract mathematics, is an essential part of research in many other disciplines. You therefore can gain an exceptional range of knowledge and skills that are currently in demand in mathematically-oriented employment; in business, commerce, industry, government service, education and in the wider economy.

Topics include:

* pure mathematics, including geometry, algebra, analysis and number theory* applied topics such as mathematical physics, cryptography, mathematical modelling, differential equations and dynamical systems* statistical, financial and analytical methods such as optimisation and the study of risk

As well as these mathematical topics, this degree develops your programming skills in languages such as Python and SQL, and you learn to solve sophisticated problems using computational toolkits such as MATLAB, Maple and R.

Our MMath Mathematics course is an Integrated Masters that gives you the chance to fast-track a Masters degree and complete your final-year in nine months, compared with a regular MSc which usually takes twelve months. Our course covers key skills in mathematics with the opportunity to apply theory and methods. Plus, combining your undergraduate and postgraduate study in one degree gives you a strong theoretical background as well as specialist expertise through independent research. This combination makes graduates from our course attractive candidates for many employers.

### Professional accreditation

This programme is accredited to meet the educational requirements of the Chartered Mathematician designation awarded by the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications.

Why we're great.

* 86% of Essex graduates are in employment or further study (Graduate Outcomes 2024).
* We’re ranked 25th in UK for mathematics (The Guardian University Guide 2025).
* We are continually broadening the array of expertise in our School, giving you a wide range of options and letting you tailor your degree to your interests.

### Our expert staff

As well as being world-class academics, our staff are award-winning teachers. Many of [our academics](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science/people/academic) have won national or regional awards for lecturing, and many of them are qualified and accredited teachers – something which is very rare at a university.

Our School is committed to providing you with the academic support you need to succeed. Our flexible policy means some staff are always available, whilst others maintain regular drop-in times. Staff are always happy to arrange appointments for longer discussions, and no issue is too big or too small.

Our innovative [research groups](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science/research) are working on a broad range of collaborative areas tackling real-world issues.

* Our data scientists carefully consider how not to lie, and how not to get lied to with data. Interpreting data correctly is especially important because much of our data science research is applied directly or indirectly to social policies, including health, care and education.* We do practical research with financial data (for example, assessing the risk of collapse of the UK's banking system) as well as theoretical research in financial instruments such as insurance policies or asset portfolios.* We also research how physical processes develop in time and space. Applications of this range from modelling epilepsy to modelling electronic cables.* Our optimisation experts work out how to do the same job with less resource, or how to do more with the same resource.* Our pure maths group are currently working on two new funded projects entitled ‘Machine learning for recognising tangled 3D objects' and ‘Searching for gems in the landscape of cyclically presented groups'.* We also do research into mathematical education and use exciting technologies such as electroencephalography or eye tracking to measure exactly what a learner is feeling. Our research aims to encourage the implementation of ‘the four Cs' of modern education, which are critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity.

### Specialist facilities

* In addition to teaching, we have a [Maths Support Centre](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/students/study-resources/tdc/maths/default.aspx) which offers help to students on a range of mathematical problems. Throughout term time, we can chat through mathematical problems either on a one-to-one or small group basis.* We have a dedicated social and study space for maths students, situated in the STEM Centre.* We host regular events and seminars throughout the year.* Our students run a lively Mathematics Society, an active and social group where you can explore your interest in your subject with other students

### Your future

Clear thinkers are required in every profession, so the successful mathematician has an extensive choice of potential careers. Mathematics students are in demand from a wide range of employers in a host of occupations, including financial analysis, management, public administration and accountancy. [The Council for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.mathscareers.org.uk/career-profiles//) offers further information on careers in mathematics.

Our recent graduates have gone on to work for a wide range of high-profile companies, including:

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.

Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our [programme specifications](http://www.essex.ac.uk/programmespecs/). The University would inform and engage with you if your course was to be discontinued, and would provide you with options, where appropriate, in line with our Compensation and Refund Policy.*

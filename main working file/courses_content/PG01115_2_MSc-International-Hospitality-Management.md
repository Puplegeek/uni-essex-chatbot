## Overview

The details

Course: 
International Hospitality Management

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Part-time

Duration: 
2 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Edge Hotel School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/edge-hotel-school)

**This page is for the January start course. Information on the October start version of the course can be found [here](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg01115/1/msc-international-hospitality-management).**

In one of the world's most global industries, employers are looking for creativity, confidence and passion from the next generation of hospitality leaders.

It takes more than knowledge to succeed – it takes experience, strategy and understanding. [Edge Hotel School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/edge-hotel-school/) is the first hotel school of its kind in the UK, with learning and student experience bolstered by the use of its own fully-commercial 4\* country house hotel, [Wivenhoe House](https://www.wivenhoehouse.co.uk/).

The growth of the worldwide hospitality industry has been dominated by American and, to a lesser extent, Western European multinational brands. However, the last decade has seen a significant increase in the emergence and growth of successful hospitality organisations from a range of emerging nations and cultures from across the world. This programme is designed to reflect the increasing cultural and geographical diversity of the hospitality industry.

As a global industry, the hospitality sector is driven by human connection and personalisation, relying on the experiences its workforce can deliver and the memories its customers create. To be a leader in the hospitality or events sector you'll need the creativity to think outside of the norm and the confidence to manage everything thrown at you in an industry where no two days are the same.

With the MSc International Hospitality Management, these two strands are intertwined. Led by the Edge Hotel School and delivered in collaboration with [Essex Business School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-business-school/), this programme combines a deeper understanding of the hospitality sector with the skills and knowledge of successful management.

Why we're great.

* Learn from a dedicated team of experts with decades of experience in hospitality, events and management.
* The first hotel school of its kind in the UK to utilise a fully commercial 4\* hotel as part of the learning and development experience.
* Create a wide-ranging network of professional contacts to create exciting opportunities and bolster your career prospects.

## Structure

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.

A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

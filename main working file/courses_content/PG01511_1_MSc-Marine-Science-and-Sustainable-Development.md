Based in: 
[Life Sciences (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/biological-sciences)

Our ocean is the largest connected system on Earth, but it is under increasing pressure from expanding human activities and the climate crisis. As a future expert in marine science, you learn to identify sustainable development opportunities and assist conservation science, ‘blue economy' industries, and ocean governance.

Our MSc Marine Science and Sustainable Development course aligns with the United Nations' Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development to build relevant expertise and reverse the cycle of decline in ocean health. While critically examining the structure, function and benefits of marine systems in our taught modules in our [School of Life Sciences](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences), you also have access to modules provided by our Department of Government, which is ranked 6th in the UK for research power (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021), before embarking on a work placement with government, industry, or non-government organisations to conduct an independent research project over the summer.

You learn to develop your networks, including carefully selected research providers, decision-makers, and stakeholders with whom you can design and adapt existing policy to mitigate the impact of environmental change. Your developing skills are underpinned by policy-oriented projects within our School, supporting you to find your own external placement or a project with one of our external partners, such as:

* The Ornamental Aquatic Trade Association: setting standards for the ornamental aquatic industry* The Centre for Environment, Fisheries, and Aquaculture Science ([Cefas](https://www.cefas.co.uk/)) in Lowestoft, Suffolk: the marine and freshwater agency of the Government's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)

You benefit from the vast breadth of research carried out by our internationally recognised academics, and engage with research activities of our School both in the UK and abroad.

Specifically, you explore topics including:

* adaptation strategies, mitigation strategies and science-informed policy responses.* the state of the environment and the politics of environmental challenges* characteristics of marine environments and anthropogenic pressures* sustainable marine resource management and conservation

When you graduate, you become part of the growing community of practitioners in marine sustainable development. You will have gained the most sought-after skills that make you well-placed for employment in the marine environment sector or provide an avenue for further academic study.

We’re ranked 54th (14th in UK) for promoting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal for climate action (Times Higher Education Impact Rankings 2024).

## Structure

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

East 15 Acting School's MA Theatre Directing is designed for practicing or aspiring directors seeking to establish themselves as professional theatre directors.

The course brings together a diverse mix of emerging theatre directors from the UK and around the world, under the guidance of experienced directors and professional practitioners from the UK and overseas. With strong ties to the London theatre world, you'll have access to top-tier training as well as invaluable professional networks needed to build a successful career in directing theatre.

The MA is a one-year, full-time programme. You'll undertake four modules over three terms, followed by a three-month period of independent study, at the end of which you'll present a Director's Production Workbook (or your MA Dissertation). You'll have the option to choose four modules from a range of seven to eight which we offer in a year. While the menu of modules varies from year to year, they cover a diverse range of directorial practices such as Shakespeare, Contemporary British Drama, Comedy, Musical Theatre and Opera, Physical Theatre, and much more.

We also run some modules overseas, most recently in Poland with the legendary Song of the Goat Theatre Company, and in Bali, involving specialist practical study in an alternative cultural environment.

Some of the highlights of this course include:

* A unique modular structure, enabling you to tailor your training to discover your own artistic voice as a theatre director.
* International module options in Bali and Poland.
* Regularly direct work with actors from our acting courses, including BA Acting, BA Acting (International), MA Acting and MFA Acting (International)
* Facilitated opportunities to connect with playwrights, designers, producers, stage managers and theatre technicians to build your creative network.
* Intensive practical training by leading professional directors in the UK.
* Daily sessions in the rehearsal studio, leading and participating in ensemble activity that is modelled on the daily practice of a working freelance theatre director.
* Opportunities to work on attachment with UK theatre companies and assistant direct in the West End or at London venues such as Hampstead Theatre, Soho Theatre, Park Theatre, Arcola Theatre, Watford Playhouse and Queens Theatre Hornchurch.
* Professional preparation sessions guiding you in how to find work, how to self-produce, and how to create your own artistic opportunities as a freelance theatre-maker
* Be a part of the largest and most established professional theatre directing programme in Europe.

Visiting artists and guest workshop leaders in the past three years have included internationally renowned artists such as:

+ Thomas Ostermeier
+ Mike Leigh
+ Yael Farber
+ Bijan Sheibani
+ Rufus Norris
+ Robert Icke
+ John McGrath
+ Grzegorz Bral
+ Philip Ridley
+ Lyndsey Turner

MA Theatre Directing is open to applicants with a background in theatre directing or related fields, and is specifically tailored to those seeking professional development in this area. Study is full-time, but some modules enable time away to pursue professional theatre work.

### Our expert staff

Our training is by professionals and for professionals, allowing our graduates to work successfully across the globe.

Our international, outstanding teaching faculty is made up of professionals from all areas of live and recorded performance.

Learn more about our staff [here](https://www.east15.ac.uk/staff).

### Specialist facilities

Our [Loughton Campus](https://www.east15.ac.uk/loughton) is perfectly located, providing access to both the rich, cultural diversity of London and an attractive and peaceful setting in which to study.

We are just a five-minute walk from London Underground station, Debden, where you can travel in only thirty minutes to Central London, West End theatres and mainline train stations including the Eurostar.

We have three sites at our Loughton Campus – Hatfields, Roding House and Unit Four. Hatfields is a beautiful Georgian dower house, set in five acres of lawns with orchards, flowerbeds and a small lake, providing an idyllic atmosphere for study, relaxation and performance.

Just a short walk from Hatfields is Roding House, a £1.3 million facility containing 10 rehearsal rooms, a green room/café, a sound recording studio and a video editing suite, and our costume department.

Next to Roding House, Unit Four is a £1.5 million facility which is home to the Stage & Production Management department. The Unit contains a large workshop, paint shop, prop shop, prop storage facilities and teaching spaces.

Our on-site Corbett Theatre is named in honour of Harry H Corbett, a key member of Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop and early benefactor of East 15. It is used extensively for student productions and is a practical training hub for our BA Stage and Production Management students.

The building is a medieval tithe barn that was dismantled and transported to Hatfields in the 1960s. These unusual origins create a unique performance space with a special atmosphere. Renovated to include full technical facilities, tiered seating for 130 people and fitted dressing rooms, the theatre provides an excellent resource for public productions, while the adjacent Bar and Café provides a social meeting point for students and staff.

### Your future

Graduates of our MA in Theatre Directing work all over the world as professional theatre directors and Artistic Directors, as well as occupying distinguished positions in universities and leading drama schools.

We are particularly proud of the speed with which our directors create work and find employment after they leave the course. It is very common for work initiated during the course to be developed, with a further life at the London or Edinburgh Fringe. Our graduate directors regularly apply what they have learned during their training in the professional world.

The training you receive at East 15 doesn’t simply give you the craft skills to direct plays, it also equips you with the resilience to navigate a career as a freelance artist. The course is especially suited to those who see theatre as a global language and wish to pursue their work through international collaborations and partnerships.

> "The Theatre Directing course at East 15 not only trained me to become a theatre director, but also prepared me for the position of Artistic Director. During a recent interview process, I read and studied all of my notes, projects and logbook from the Artistic Director module at East 15. All of this invaluable information not only prepared me for my interview, but also gave me the confidence to pursue this highly coveted job. Finally, after three intense interviews, I was chosen for the role of Artistic Director at Theatre Orangeville. I highly recommend this course to any theatre artist and practitioner. It will change the trajectory of your career and life."

> Jennifer Stewart, Artistic Director of Theatre Orangeville, Ontario, Canada

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

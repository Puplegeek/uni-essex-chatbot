## Overview

The details

Course: 
Philosophy

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
4 - 5 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Philosophical, Historical, and Interdisciplinary Studies (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/philosophical-historical-and-interdisciplinary-studies)

Our Integrated PhD in Philosophy at Essex is designed for students who seek to engage deeply with both theoretical and applied philosophical questions, blending foundational postgraduate training with the pursuit of independent research. Philosophy at Essex is distinctive for its commitment to addressing existential, social, and political issues that connect directly to everyday life. Our course bridges the divide between analytic and continental traditions, fostering dialogue across philosophical boundaries in ways that few universities can offer.

The Integrated PhD course begins with Masters-level work, providing a strong grounding in modern and contemporary European philosophy. You will engage with key areas such as critical theory, phenomenology, German Idealism, aesthetics, existentialism, contemporary French philosophy, philosophy and psychoanalysis, and medical humanities. Through the intensive Writing Workshop, you develop essential research, writing, and employability skills, culminating in a research-driven Masters-level dissertation.

You then progress onto the PhD, where we offer supervision in a wide range of fields, including continental philosophy, social and political philosophy, history of philosophy, and medical humanities. Essex’s expertise lies particularly in the convergence between analytic and continental philosophy, with research concentrations in moral and political philosophy. Our internationally renowned faculty ensures you have the support and academic environment necessary to produce a substantial body of original research in your chosen area of specialisation.

Please be aware that progression to the PhD component of the degree is conditional on successful completion of the Masters and meeting the entry requirements of the PhD course.

Why we're great.

* We are renowned for our combination of Continental and Anglo-American philosophy.
* The School is also home to both the Essex Autonomy Project and the Ethics of Powerlessness, major interdisciplinary projects funded by the AHRC (Arts and Humanities Research Council), which aim to investigate the role of autonomous judgement and conditions of powerlessness in many aspects of human life.
* Work alongside industry-active professionals.

### Our expert staff

Research students are allocated a supervisor whose role is to guide them through the different stages of the research degree. In some cases, students may have joint supervision by two members of staff.

Initially, supervisors help with the development of the research topic and plan. Students have regular one-to-one meetings to discuss progress on research.

Our open-minded and enthusiastic staff are known for our unique combination of Anglo-American and European philosophy, and as a leading centre for critical theory, phenomenology, German idealism and medical humanities. Some recent projects and publications include:

* Timo Jütten's major new Leverhulme-funded research project, Competition and Competitiveness* Irene McMullin's Existential Flourishing: A Phenomenology of the Virtues (Cambridge, 2018)* Steve Gormley's Deliberative Theory and Deconstruction: A Democratic Venture (Edinburgh, 2020)

### Specialist facilities

We have a large well-equipped room for use by our research students. There are desks, computers and comfortable seating, so our students use this room for meetings and reading groups, as well as private study. There are two additional rooms with desks and chairs for the use of research students, including one which overlooks a quiet courtyard.

### Your future

This Integrated PhD offers a comprehensive philosophical education, preparing you for academic and professional careers that require deep critical thinking, a broad understanding of philosophical traditions, and advanced research capabilities.

Many of our graduates have progressed successfully to further research and an academic career. Philosophers with a PhD from Essex have taught at many UK universities, including Warwick, Oxford, Sussex, Reading, Bolton, Manchester Metropolitan, and Keele, and also at numerous institutions abroad (such as University College Dublin, the University of Malta, and Grand Valley State University, USA). Our other philosophy graduates have gone into careers in law, the media, local administration, HM Revenue and Customs, and top jobs in the Civil Service.

### English language requirements

If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 7.0, or equivalent, with a minimum score of 5.5 in all other components.

## Structure

### Course structure

The PhD component of this course doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.

We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

### Assessment

Within our School of Philosophy and Art History, you'll invest time mainly working on your thesis with the help of a Research Supervisor. Twice a year, you will have a supervisory panel meeting, which provides a formal opportunity to discuss progress with both your supervisor and another member of the faculty. The purpose of the Supervisory Panels is to form an overview of your work and to monitor progress, taking into account both academic and personal issues.

During your first Supervisory Panel in January, new research students are required to submit material in a specific form: a 5,000-word Critical Literature Review (ie an evaluative account of a selection from the most relevant scholarly literature in their area of research), and a 2,000-word detailed Project Outline. The Project Outline should locate the student's research in the field described in the Critical Literature Review. In the case of PhD students, this material – coupled with a substantial piece of research toward the PhD (10,000 words) will form the basis of the Confirmation Panel's assessment of the student's progress in June, and, subsequently, of the Progress Committee's recommendation to the Graduate School concerning the continuation of the student's studies after the first year. At subsequent Supervisory Panels, students are expected to submit draft chapters of their thesis totaling no more than 10,000 words in length.

PhD students are also required to present their work to the Departmental Research Colloquium at least once in the student's research career. The Colloquium allows three research students to present their current work (a 30-minute presentation followed by 30 minutes of questions). Both staff and students are in attendance and the format is informal. The Colloquium allows research students to improve their confidence, and to gain experience of defending their ideas in discussion.

We also encourage our research students to attend training courses whenever their research requires acquiring new skills and to take part in our many research seminars, reading groups and mini-courses.

### Dissertation

You can enter into completion if, by the end of your third year, you have a complete draft of all thesis chapters (excluding introduction and conclusions) and these are of good quality.

Examiners look for evidence of training in the appropriate methods, for knowledge of relevant literature concerning the topic in question, and for general competence in background related to the topic. In the case of a PhD thesis, in particular, examiners look for evidence of originality. A doctoral thesis must show evidence of being a significant contribution to knowledge and of the capacity of the candidate to pursue further research without supervision.

The maximum length for a PhD thesis, whether by research or as part of the Integrated PhD, is 80,000 words.

## Fees and funding

### Home/UK fee

£5,006 per year

### International fee

£19,650 per year

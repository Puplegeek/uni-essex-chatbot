## Overview

The details

Course: 
Childhood Studies

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychosocial-and-psychoanalytic-studies)

Our MA Childhood Studies offers a unique psychosocial focus, seeking to understand not only the outer social experience of children but also their complex inner, emotional worlds.

Building upon our existing expertise in postgraduate courses like [refugee care](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg00763/1/ma-refugee-care), [psychoanalytic studies](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg00747/1/ma-psychoanalytic-studies) and [psychodynamic counselling](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg00750/2/ma-psychodynamic-counselling), this programme offers much more than you would find in other MA Childhood Studies courses.

Our inherently interdisciplinary programme is rooted in psychosocial, sociological and psychodynamic approaches. Drawing on the history of Childhood Studies and the best contemporary research, including the excellent research and practice experience of our academics, modules will explore a variety of subjects, including:

* Families and peer relationships* Emotions and the inner worlds of children* Education* The role of play and leisure* Generation and intergenerational relationships* Gender and sexuality* Race and ethnicity* Cross-cultural experiences of childhood* Children, popular culture and literature,* Children with disabilities* Children and the state* Ethical research with children and young people* Spaces and places of children's lives* Intersectionality

Our MA Childhood Studies programme will equip you for a career in sectors including education, health, international fields such as the charitable sector and NGOs, social care including children's homes, therapeutic communities and supporting children and their families. This course is available to study full-time or part-time, and also acts as a stepping stone to further qualifications in specific professions such as social work or counselling as well as [PhD study.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pr01388/1/phd-childhood-studies?startdate=24-10&studymode=FullTime)

If you're committed to understanding the child as a whole, incorporating their complex emotional worlds, and want to use this knowledge to improve the experience of children in a variety of settings, welcome home.

Why we're great.

* Our unique interdisciplinary approach combines psychosocial, sociological and psychodynamic approaches
* You'll be taught by lecturers who bring both academic and practical knowledge from years of working with children
* Close links with health, education and social care services ensures our courses are highly credible

> "The MA in Childhood Studies equipped me with a unique interdisciplinary and psychosocial understanding of childhood and youth through the lens of psychoanalysis, sociology, and psychology. Through this comprehensive approach to understanding experiences, I was able to weave the various social, cultural, historical, and political processes and structures with the complex inner worlds of children and young people”
>
> Ameya Jain, MA Childhood Studies 2022-2023
>
> "As a BA Childhood Studies graduate I could not wait to join the MA and explore the field of Childhood Studies further within the Psychoanalytic and Psychosocial Department at Essex; and the exciting modules offered. I believe this is still a young and vibrant field with opportunities for us (MA Students) to really contribute to the future of Childhood Studies. My course was filled with inspiring students from many academic backgrounds and lecturers. This is an opportunity to study Childhood Studies in a unique environment where inner and outer world's meet. I enjoyed the many opportunities to attend fabulous guest lectures and inter departmental events, broadening and enhancing my overall experience”

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: CORE

Critical Debates in Childhood and Childhood Studies

(30 CREDITS)

This module draws predominantly on psychosocial studies, sociology, and childhood studies and aims to explore and respond to debates at the forefront of childhood studies and of the experience of being a child. The historical development of both childhood studies and the concept of `children` and `childhood` are outlined and you are introduced to core disciplines including developmental psychology, psychoanalysis and sociology.
You will be encouraged to reflect upon the position of certain bodies of knowledge within the field of childhood studies. This includes analysing the figure of the child embodied within each disciplinary approach and interrogating how this is manifest in theory and in children`s everyday lives. The module will use this foundation to go on to discuss core aspects of the conceptual frameworks which guide or govern childhood studies including agency, subjects, actors, relationality, and generation. Included crucially here are approaches to the rights, voices and participation of children.

[View Critical Debates in Childhood and Childhood Studies on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA943&year=25)

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY

Research with Children and Young People

(30 CREDITS)

This module introduces students to the philosophies and practical tools which characterise research with children to enable students to undertake primary research in their dissertations and future professions.
The module considers a range of methodological approaches to both quantitative and qualitative research. Specific tools such as surveys and questionnaires, observation, interviews, focus groups, ethnographic approaches, and virtual approaches, are examined and practiced. You will critically consider ethical issues in research with children, adult and child power relations, and spaces and places of research with children and young people, including schools, children's homes and the therapeutic space.

[View Research with Children and Young People on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA944&year=25)

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY

Children’s Emotional Worlds

(15 CREDITS)

The study of emotions in the social sciences was a once relatively neglected field and now is one burgeoning with a huge diversity of different perspectives, approaches, and priorities. This module will explore how such understandings of emotions as social, developmental, individual, unconscious, discursive, and collective are applied to the study of childhood and to children's experiences.
Within this module you will be introduced to the historical study of emotions in sociology and consider how children`s emotional development is framed in developmental psychology, psychoanalytic studies and neuroscience perspectives. The module will explicitly propose and consider the benefits of a psychosocial approach to understanding children's emotions and apply such perspectives to a range of topical issues in relation to children`s emotional experiences, wellbeing, and mental health.

[View Children’s Emotional Worlds on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA949&year=25)

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY

Geographies of Childhood and Youth

(15 CREDITS)

This module `Geographies of Children and Youth` will critically examine the diverse experiences of children and young people across time and space and consider how the discursive and material construction of childhood is shaped by these geographical concepts. Theoretical frameworks such as post-structuralism, post-colonialism, and critical race theory will be deployed to examine core issues in childhood studies such as home and homelessness, institutions and the institutionalisation of childhood, the street, cultural and community participation, and nation and nationhood. A critical approach to children`s rights is adopted throughout, taking a rights-respecting approach while evaluating the articulation and application of rights to diverse childhoods and children`s lived experiences.

(20 CREDITS)

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY

Relational Childhoods

(15 CREDITS)

The sociology of childhood emerged in the latter part of the twentieth century, developing the well- established paradigm of the social construction of childhood to examine the active construction of children`s lives, the lives of those around them and of the societies in which they live.
This module on `Relational Childhoods` will critically explore the dominant theoretical assumptions that lie behind the social construction of childhood, developing an interdisciplinary perspective that can integrate the relational aspects of three related disciplines, sociology, developmental psychology and psychoanalysis. Relational concepts such as `habitus`, `love and learning` and `interdependencies` will be used to examine core issues in childhood studies such as parenting in families and educational institutions.

[View Relational Childhoods on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA948&year=25)

COMPONENT 07: CORE

Dissertation - Childhood Studies

(60 CREDITS)

This module provides the framework for students to complete their dissertation projects. Dissertations are an important and represent an intellectual journey where students can apply the knowledge gained and use this in a creative way to deepen understanding of themes and issues they are interested in.
Time and energy can be devoted, in a supported environment, to demonstrate something significant about your insights and understanding. It can be thought of as the culmination of your course. Although you should be thinking and working on dissertations by developing ideas and exploring literature throughout the year it will be mainly written over the summer term and summer vacation period. Throughout this time you will be supported by your dissertation supervisor.

**This is an online version of our MA Refugee Care, designed specifically for interactive, online delivery.

Where possible, flexibility will be exercised to accommodate different time zones. You will graduate with the same qualification as our campus based MA.**

Interested in the course but want to study on campus? [Read about our campus based course instead](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg00763/1/ma-refugee-care).

Founded in 2004, this unique course brings together people from diverse walks of life and parts of the globe to explore how we can therapeutically care for refugee people more effectively. Whereas other institutions and courses focus on the study of refugee people, our course focuses on the caring of them, on how we can intervene therapeutically to support this segment of our society.

Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, there was demand to offer this course online and we approved an online option of the MA Refugee Care course, which is identical in content (number of teaching modules, their structure and themes), and equal in value and experience. This option enables students anywhere in the world to take this course without reducing its quality, whilst they continue to live in their own localities and retaining with their existing employment.

Through lively seminar discussion we unpack the experiences of involuntarily dislocated people as multi-dimensional and complex, and explore psychosocial perspectives and different types of intervention and activism. We discuss how we become more *therapeutic* in our work with them as a distinct skill, different from offering psychotherapy. Through our course, you gain practical expertise in challenging negative and limiting stereotypes of asylum seekers and refugee people as being merely traumatised individuals, passive recipients of help. You also gain new insight into effective humanitarian work with these individuals, families and communities. The course provides you with the tools to discern the suffering, pain and distress of these people, whilst also appreciating their retained strengths *(Resilience)* as well as their new strengths that they acquired from being exposed to adversity *(Adversity-Activated Development)*. This programme is closely associated with the Centre for Trauma Asylum and Refugees.

Our course teaching staff are made up from the multidisciplinary practitioner expertise of the [Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychosocial-and-psychoanalytic-studies), guest speakers who are world experts in the field, activists, academics and practitioners. You will learn our unique, innovative and proven approach enabling you to work directly with involuntarily dislocated people, combining theory and practice. We offer valuable opportunities to gain first-hand experience through supportive work placements, which are individually tailored to your needs and further professional development.

Students often come with a wealth of professional or other experience in fields such as education, nursing, social work, human rights, law, politics, philosophy, psychology, therapy, medicine, art, literature and media studies. We also welcome people coming to Refugee Care anew, with an interest in working directly with refugee people, asylum seekers or other involuntarily dislocated groups of people, or conducting conceptual or empirical research in this area. Students may successfully combine study on our course with part-time work with charity sector organisations.

The focus of this course is on the human experience and lived realities, and on how to intervene therapeutically to improve them, with topics studied including:

* Psychosocial perspectives to human rights interventions* Complexities of victimisation in Severe Forms of Collective Adversity* Psychosocial meanings of home and the implications of loss of home* Systemic and dynamic complexities of the refugee experience* Contingencies of identifying needs and therapeutic responses to them* Theory and scope of the psycho-social approach to refugee care* Psychodynamic and systemic approaches to refugee care* Theories of trauma, PTSD, resilience and adversity-activated development* Wider parameters within which the refugee condition is located and constructed* Organisational dimensions* Conceptualising research in this field

### Placement

The Placement is an integral part of the MA Refugee course, putting theory to practice. Staff will help you find an appropriate placement that best matches your interests and career goals using our extensive connections and the Essex graduate network. For the online option of this course, placements are arranged either online or with a local relevant organisation that you have access to.

### Scholarships

We have welcomed many [Chevening recipients](https://www.chevening.org/partners/university-of-essex/%22) on this course over the years, as well as students from refugee situations and backgrounds. A  [range of scholarships and bursaries](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/masters/fees-and-funding/scholarships-and-funding) are available to students studying this course, including our [Refugee Bursary](https://www.essex.ac.uk/scholarships/refugee-bursary) amongst others.

The Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies is offering scholarships to assist postgraduate students taking the full-time on-campus or online MA Refugee Care course within the Department. The scholarship, which is open to all successful applicants to either of these two courses, covers all the university fees. For further information and details on how to apply please visit the [Essex Futures Refugee Care Scholarship webpage.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/scholarships/essex-futures-refugee-care-scholarship)

Why we're great.

* This is the only course in the world to focus on the therapeutic care of asylum seekers, refugee people and other involuntarily dislocated people, as opposed to merely studying them as social or political phenomena.
* A yearly visit to an Asylum Tribunal gives you unique access to real-world complexities, with the opportunity to talk to judges, lawyers and Home Office staff about concrete cases and their work, in general.
* We have now introduced several scholarships to cover all university fees, through the Essex Futures Refugee Care Scholarships scheme, for those successful applicants who are experiencing particularly difficult financial constraints.

### Our expert staff

The course team, directed by the founder [Professor Renos Papadopoulos](http://www.essex.ac.uk/cps/staff/profile.aspx?ID=440) (on research leave for the 2024/25 academic year), a pioneer in this field, who has been working as a consultant to the UN and other International and Non-Governmental Organisations in many parts of the world for many years, is further enhanced by other world experts from a variety of relevant fields. One of the strengths of this course is that the staff team consists of academic-practitioners, actively engaged in academic, research and field work within this area.

The course is located in the [Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies](http://www.essex.ac.uk/cps/) and associated with the [Department of Sociology and Criminology](http://www.essex.ac.uk/sociology/).

Being part of a leading university in the study of social sciences means you are surrounded by strong departments that fully support and enhance our work. This allows you to gain the opportunity to work with and be taught by top world-class scholars and top professionals in their fields.

### Specialist facilities

The course is closely associated with the internationally renowned [Centre for Trauma Asylum and Refugees](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/trauma-asylum-and-refugees) (CTAR) that is involved in training, research and intervention projects in many parts of the world. The course also has strong links with the prestigious [Human Rights Centre](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/human-rights), as well as with the [Transitional Justice Network](https://www.essex.ac.uk/research-projects/essex-transitional-justice-network) the [Armed Conflict and Crisis Hub](https://www.essex.ac.uk/research-projects/essex-armed-conflict-and-crisis-hub), and the
[Centre for Migration Studies.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/migration-studies)

A unique feature of the course is the annual visit to an Asylum Tribunal where students attend hearings and have the opportunity of interacting with the judges and other related specialists about the specific cases observed as well as about their work and wider asylum issues.

Our Albert Sloman Library is well stocked with books, journals, electronic resources and major archives relevant to our work and, in addition, we have our own library of specialist books and journals. Moreover, it offers a wide range of study and research resources as well as individual tutorials. Through this Library you will be able to access in its premises and online everything that you need for successfully completing this course.

### Your future

The field of refugee work is not only topical but is expanding and developing rapidly, creating new employment initiatives and opportunities. This course is unique in equipping students to work directly in this field.

Accordingly, our graduates make an impact by applying the innovative approach that our course offers in a variety of contexts and disciplines. Many of our graduates go on to play a leading role in many spheres e.g. education, social and community work, human rights, emergency and humanitarian aid, national, international and non-governmental organisations.

> "Having worked for many years with refugees in different contexts, I wasn’t expecting to be exposed to so many new ideas and perspectives. The MA Refugee Care is an amazing course which has allowed me to exchange views with people from all over the world. I would recommend it to anyone who is intending to work with refugees."

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

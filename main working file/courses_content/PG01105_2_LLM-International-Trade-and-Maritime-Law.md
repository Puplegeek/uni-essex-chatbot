Delve in to the legal principles surrounding the exciting field of global trade with a focus on the shipping industry. Specialise in two key areas of commercial law: International Trade law and Maritime Law, building your knowledge and skills within a continuously growing niche industry. These two areas bring together many fields of law from advanced contract to the law of the sea. The international nature of this course, covering international trade and shipping, is matched by the diverse staff and students that form our truly global community.

You develop a thorough and in-depth knowledge and understanding of the main principles of law in the areas of international trade and maritime law. Exploring the social, political, cultural and economic background of the laws in question, you gain an understanding of how national, European Union Law and International Law interact. You will cover a variety of topics, including:

* Financing International Trade* How Marine Insurance protects ships and cargoes* International Law of the Sea issues* Sale and Carriage of Goods by Sea Contracts* Environmental Protection Laws

We are ranked 49th for Law in THE World University Rankings by subject 2024, which is 9th in the UK, and we are 3rd in the UK for research power in law (THE research power measure, REF2021).

Our course uniquely combines International Trade Law with a particular focus on Maritime Law and our close proximity to London means you are near the heart of the UK Finance, Insurance and Shipping industries. You develop your intellectual and critical faculties, encouraging you to think independently and teaching you to present rational, coherent and accurate arguments orally and in writing. It will provide you with an excellent foundation for any career.

Why we're great.

* Explore the regulation concerning the sale and transaction of goods around the world and make a global impact
* Gain relevant industry work experience within an external business or organisation

### Placement year

LLM International Trade and Maritime Law with Professional Placement offers a unique opportunity for you to gain relevant work experience within an external business or organisation, giving you a competitive edge in the job market and providing you with key contacts within the industry.

Its aim is to allow you to acquire industry experience and, especially, develop an appreciation of how the skills acquired in the taught part of the course can be applied to real-world work.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

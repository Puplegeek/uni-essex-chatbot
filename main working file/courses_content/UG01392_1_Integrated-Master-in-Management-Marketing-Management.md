How do today's marketers communicate to global audiences and respect diverse cultural sensitivities? Is it possible for managers to deliver a profitable strategy that is also ethical and sustainable?

Our MMan Marketing and Management offers you an integrated Bachelors and Masters degree, allowing you to progress seamlessly from your undergraduate to postgraduate studies within a single course.

This course enables you to combine the study of management with the opportunity to develop marketing expertise. You learn what's involved in managing modern organisations and understand the role of customers, consumers, the service relationship and brand management.

At [Essex Business School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-business-school), we encourage you to become an independent thinker and act creatively and strategically to help organisations succeed, whatever their challenge.

We look beyond the marketing mix to develop your practical skills in communication, data analysis and critical thinking in order to explore the challenges managers and marketers face, such as gender stereotyping, marketing ethics and promoting products and services internationally.

You explore subjects such as:

* digital marketing and social media
* marketing management
* consumer behaviour
* brand management
* business strategy
* organisational behaviour
* marketing and communication theories

The first year focuses on the marketing and management area of your degree and introduces you to the main functional areas of business, including accounting, finance, and HR. This gives you flexibility to work in any area of business after graduation.

In your final year, you have the opportunity to put your knowledge into practice by completing an in-depth, independent research project or dissertation which can focus on either management or marketing or combine elements from both as you prefer. This will give you the chance to further develop vital employment skills in the areas of research, time management and critical thinking, as well as offering you the opportunity to explore what interests you.

Essex Business School is committed to ethical and sustainable business and we are a signatory of the [UN Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-business-school/professional-accreditation). By studying with us, you gain more than the foundations for a successful career in marketing management, you are part of a movement that seeks to make organisations better places to do business.

MMan Marketing and Management can also be taken with an optional study abroad or placement year where you can add even more value to your CV through work or international experience.

You can [study abroad](https://www.essex.ac.uk/study-abroad) with one of our exchange partners in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, the Middle East, Hong Kong and Japan.

### Course structure

This course allows you to specialise in the areas of both business management and marketing, as well as providing a more broad overview of other important topics.

In the first year our current students cover the fundamentals that every business manager needs to know and be introduced to the specialisation of marketing. However, we are planning some changes to our first year and we'll be tailoring it more closely to your chosen course.

In your second, third and final year your compulsory modules will provide a deep understanding of management and marketing, whilst your optional modules will allow you to follow these themes further or to explore other areas.

We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of core/compulsory modules, and optional modules chosen from lists. Please be aware that we are planning changes to our first year to make it more relevant to your chosen course.

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The following modules are based on the current course structure and may change in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |

COMPONENT 01: CORE

Introduction to Management

(15 CREDITS)

Introduction to Management is a broad-ranging module intended to provide a foundation in the most significant issues in management theory and practice, as well as to prepare you for related modules in subsequent years of your degree course.
Because theoretical explanations – i.e., academic interpretations of what managers do and even of what they say they do – and what managers actually do in real organisations on a day-to-day basis may differ, we will also draw out some of the connections and dis-junctures between management theory and management practice. Our teaching also emphasises the ethics of managing and how to balance the bottom line of the business with the organisation's wider responsibilities to society and other stakeholders.

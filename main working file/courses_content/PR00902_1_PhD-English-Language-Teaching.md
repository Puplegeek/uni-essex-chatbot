## Overview

The details

Course: 
English Language Teaching

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
3 - 4 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Language and Linguistics](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/language-and-linguistics)

We offer supervision for our PhD English Language Teaching in a wide range of areas, including: vocabulary teaching, teaching reading and literacy development, writing pedagogy and academic writing, corpus-based pedagogy, teaching English to young learners, task-based language learning, language testing, classroom interaction, materials design and evaluation, teacher beliefs and teacher identity, and English for Academic Purposes, and computer-assisted language learning (CALL).

Examples of PhD projects which our students have undertaken include students' attitudes to native and non-native English language teachers, the role of metacognitive awareness in EFL reading, English teachers' beliefs about and practices of teaching methodology, and genre analysis of Japanese and British introductions to PhD theses in the field of literature.

Many of our former PhD students work in higher education institutions around the world, as teachers and/or as academic researchers, but also in teacher education, in the area of educational advice and management, programme evaluation, and syllabus design.

We also offer an MPhil in this subject.

Please note, part-time research study is also available.

Why we're great.

* Our Department of Language and Linguistics offers an outstanding teaching and research environment. We are 1st in UK for research impact in modern languages and linguistics (Grade Point Average, Research Excellence Framework 2021).
* Our students are taught, supported and supervised by staff with an international reputation for being at the forefront of research in their areas of expertise.
* We have a strong research group culture and run regular departmental seminars which feature invited external speakers.

### Our expert staff

Within our Department of Language and Linguistics, you will be allocated a supervisor whose role it is to guide you through the different stages of your research degree. In some cases, you may have joint supervision by two members of our staff.

The support provided by your supervisor is a key feature of your research student experience and you will have regular one-to-one meetings to discuss progress on your research. Initially, your supervisor will help you develop your research topic and plan.

Twice a year, you will have a supervisory board meeting, which provides a more formal opportunity to discuss your progress and agree your plans for the next six months.

### Specialist facilities

Within the Department of Language and Linguistics, we aim to provide our research students with work and storage space, including laboratory facilities and access to online bibliographies, corpora and other resources.

The University of Essex has excellent library holdings in all areas of linguistics, with online access to many periodicals and resources. We have open access computing labs running many software packages that our research students need in their work.

### Your future

Given the breadth of our provision within the Department of Language and Linguistics, career prospects for our graduates vary depending on the study undertaken. Often the career destination of our students is university lecturing or research. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the areas of linguistics we cover, this could be in departments of English, linguistics, education, sociology or cognitive science.

## Entry requirements

### English language requirements

IELTS 7.0 (6.0 in writing, with a minimum of 5.5 remaining components)

## Structure

### Course structure

A research degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

### Assessment

On our four-year route (the Integrated ‘new route' PhD), your first year is a preparatory MRes year so you take six taught modules and write an assessed MRes dissertation. This programme is ideal if you wish to develop your knowledge of existing research and improve your understanding of research methods before embarking on independent research.

On our three-year supervised research route, if you already have a solid knowledge of existing research in your field and a good understanding of research methods, plus a suitable research proposal, you immediately begin your independent research, under the guidance of your supervisor.

Within the Department of Language and Linguistics, throughout your research studies, your training needs will be regularly assessed. Every six months your progress is formally checked by a supervisory panel consisting of your supervisor, an adviser, and a chairperson. At least once a year this meeting takes place face to face to discuss how you are getting on. You report on your progress in writing by completing a form twice a year.

Your thesis has a maximum length of 80,000 words.

### Dissertation

## Fees and funding

### Home/UK fee

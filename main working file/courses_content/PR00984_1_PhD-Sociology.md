## Overview

The details

Course: 
Sociology

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
3 - 4 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Sociology and Criminology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sociology)

If you have a strong background in sociology, its cognate disciplines or interdisciplinary areas, and a well-formulated research proposal, then our PhD could be appropriate. We offer supervision that covers topics pertaining to Europe, the Americas, Africa and the Asian sub-continent, with strengths in: criminology and social justice; culture and media; economic sociology; ethnicity, migration and human rights; intimacy and gender, social theory and methodology; and survey methodology. Reflecting this, we are home to four major research centres: the Migration Studies Centre, the Centre for Research in Economic Sociology and Innovation (CRESI), the Centre for Intimate and Sexual Citizenship (CISC) and the Centre for Criminology.

As part of our wide offering of studentships, we currently have three research opportunities in the areas of sociology and economics. These projects are studentships linked with the ESRC Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSOC), which is hosted at our Institute for Social and Economic Research at our Colchester Campus. You can find out more on our [Postgraduate Research Opportunities](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/opportunities) webpage.

Part-time research study is also available.

Why we're great.

* We’re ranked 73rd globally and top 15 in the UK for sociology in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2024
* We have a dedicated Student Resource Centre offering academic and personal support
* We are 2nd in UK for research power in sociology (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021)

### Our expert staff

Within our Department of Sociology and Criminology, you will work with a supervisor whose role it is to guide you through the different stages of your research degree. In some cases, you may have joint supervision by two members of our staff and where appropriate with staff from other departments.

The support provided by your supervisor is a key feature of your research student experience and you will have regular one-to-one meetings to discuss progress on your research. Initially, your supervisor will help you develop your research topic and plan.

### Specialist facilities

At Essex, our library holdings in sociology and related disciplines like history, philosophy, politics and anthropology are strong and there are also relevant archives, including the Peter Townsend archive, as well as an extensive collection of papers relating to the work of Sigmund Freud.  
  
Within our department, we have an ever-increasing range of open-access computing facilities available for your use and, to further assist you with your research, we have bibliographic and qualitative analysis packages available on some of these machines.   
  
We have our own Student Resource Centre which provides a range of support for all our sociology students, including help with study skills.

### Your future

Many of our postgraduates go on to successful academic careers, both in the UK and overseas. Others have established careers in non-governmental organisations, local authorities, specialist think tanks, government departments, charities, media production, and market research.

Our University is strong across the social sciences so, by studying with us, you gain the opportunity to work with and be taught by well known international scholars. We have strong interdisciplinary links which mean your research and studies can be informed by a variety of perspectives.

### English language requirements

If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 6.5 overall, with no component score below 6.0, or equivalent.

## Structure

### Course structure

A research degree doesn't have a coursework structure, but instead gives you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth with the assistance of supervisor. In communicating your research scholarship through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate new and exciting knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

(0 CREDITS)

### Assessment

Within our Department of Sociology and Criminology, the PhD is a structured three-year programme of advanced study and research. We also offer an M.Phil, which is a two year programme. If you wish to undertake a PhD but are not sufficiently qualified, you may be offered our MA/MSc and PhD (four-year programme), where progression to your PhD is conditional on successful completion of your MA/MSc.

We therefore offer two routes to a PhD. If you have a strong background in sociology and/or related areas, and a well-formulated research proposal, you may be admitted directly to do supervised research and complete your PhD. Alternatively, we offer an Integrated PhD, where you follow one of our pathways in your first year, which provides you with Masters-level training, then undertake three years of PhD research.

### Dissertation

Your thesis should be no longer than 80,000 words. We expect our PhD students to complete their PhD within four years of entering, so you will be regularly monitored through supervisory and other meetings to ensure that you finish your PhD on time.

Twice a year, you will have a supervisory board meeting, which provides formal opportunities to discuss your progress and agree your immediate and future plans for your work.

## Fees and funding

### Home/UK fee

£5,006 per year

### International fee

£19,650 per year

Fees will increase for each academic year of study.

The details

Course: 
Government

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
4 - 5 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Government](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/government)

Our four-year PhD Government (with research and communication skills) course has been designed to support students who do not have English as a first language.

We recognise and understand the importance of continuing professional development for students and have designed this course for students who do not have English as a first language and may have been studying in a different country, or out of a traditional academic environment for some time.

This is a tailor-made course that seeks to combine skills and enhanced subject specific research proposals to give you the best underpinning for your doctoral studies. A core aim of the course is for students to refine English language for scholarly communication, enhance academic skills for postgraduate study, hone higher-level research skills, and master how to study and manage academic work in the UK.

The course is comprised of the following elements:

* English language for postgraduate research studies* Academic skills for postgraduate research studies* Research skills for English language teaching* Research proposal* Studying and researching in the UK

This four-year PhD does not include a Masters degree in its first year, like other existing Integrated PhDs offered at Essex. On this course you will enrol for a PhD Government (with research and communication skills) for a PhD final award, with only a PG Dip or PG Certificate available as exit awards after the first year. You will take a number of core and compulsory modules in your first year, and the next three years will be conducting your individual research project.

You can start this research degree in October. We usually offer it starting in January as well, but this entry point has been suspended for the 2025-26 year of entry.

Why we're great.

* Our department at Essex was one of the first of its kind in the UK, and has throughout its fifty years been recognised as setting the highest standard for both the scientific and critical study of politics.
* 2nd in UK for research outputs in politics and international studies (Grade Point Average, REF 2021)
* As one of our PhD students, you're part of an active and prolific research team. Our students attend seminars, present at conferences, question speakers, and debates often continue in the common room, the café, or the bar.

### Our expert staff

The support provided by your supervisor is a key feature of your experience as a research student. Your supervisor – or, in some cases, co-supervisors – guides you through the different stages of your research degree. Initially they help you to develop your research topic and plan, and then you participate in regular one-to-one meetings to comment on drafts, resolve problems and to maintain progress on your research.

Initially they help you to develop your research topic and plan, and then you participate in regular one-to-one meetings to discuss drafts, resolve problems, and to maintain progress on your research. Twice a year you have a supervisory board meeting which provides a more formal opportunity to discuss your progress and agree your plans for the coming months.

Our dedicated staff present findings at international conferences and they have published in acclaimed political journals such as the *American Political Science Review*, the *American Journal of Political Science*, the *Journal of Politics*, the *British Journal of Political Science, World Politics, International Organization, Electoral Studies, International Studies Quarterly*, the *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, the *Journal of Peace Research*, the *Journal of Education*, and many more. They have also won a number of prestigious prizes for their work.

Twice a year you have a supervisory board meeting which provides a more formal opportunity to discuss your progress and agree your plans for the next six months.

### Specialist facilities

We have desk space available for all our PhD students through shared offices and hot desks, with additional office space provided for all those involved in teaching undergraduate classes.

You also get exclusive use of a shared computer laboratory of fourteen networked computers feature extensive software for political analysis. Our university library provides access to a variety of political journals and multiple copies of textbooks, e-books, and other materials to support your learning.

### Your future

Our department provides a number of training opportunities and support services to aid your studies and to help prepare you for employment:

* **Professional Development Seminar:** First-year PhD students are invited to a seminar focusing on writing and presenting a research proposal for your thesis, developing confidence in the presentation of academic papers, learning how to write and submit journal articles, and developing skills in time management and the use of technology.* **Research Design Seminar:**  We offer a research design module to our PhD students to sharpen their skills to develop high-class research.* **Weekly discussion seminars:** Each of the department's research divisions hosts a weekly research discussion workshop, where students discuss their progress with their peers and members of staff.* **Skills training:** The Essex ESRC Doctoral Training Centre offers training courses for doctoral students, including both advanced subject-specific training and a transferable skills programme.* **Teaching opportunities:**  Our department offers paid opportunities for both Graduate Teaching Assistants and Research Assistants.

Many of our graduates secure post-doctoral research or teaching positions within universities. For example, recent graduates are now research fellows and academic staff at Oxford, University College London, Glasgow, Munich, Mannheim, ETH Zürich, Amsterdam, and Duke University in the US.

Other graduates go on to enjoy influential careers in British, European and international politics. This includes working as political lobbyists or researchers for MPs and MEPs. Our graduates also work in the civil service and in local government, for the World Bank, the United Nations, NATO, YouGov, or in the armed forces, finance, and business.

### English language requirements

If English is not your first language, then we will require you to have IELTS 5.5 with a minimum of 5.5 in each component.

  

This is below standard PHD entry criteria and reflects the nature of what this course aims to achieve via spoken and academic English development during Year 1.

## Structure

### Course structure

This four-year PhD does not include a Masters degree in its first year, like other existing Integrated PhDs offered at Essex. On this course you will enrol for a PhD Government (with research and communication skills) for a PhD final award, with only a PG Dip or PG Certificate available as exit awards after the first year. You will take a number of core and compulsory modules in your first year, and the next three years will be conducting your individual research project.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: COMPULSORY

Professional Development Seminar

(0 CREDITS)

This module focuses on writing and presenting a research proposal for the thesis, as well as other significant aspects of socialization into the discipline of political science. We aim to help PhD candidates develop a wide range of professional skills, providing the capacity to complete your PhD and compete for academic jobs.
The primary focus is the academic profession. We therefore practise a number of specific skills such as drafting research proposals, presenting results, and publication strategies. However, many of the sessions are also highly relevant for the other kinds of professions in which PhD graduates often find employment. Whatever your target, we aim in this seminar to provide a constructively critical atmosphere in which to hone various skills.

Data is the lifeblood of our society and mathematics is the language that underpins the science of understanding that data. From medicine to government offices, and market research to the environment, the collection and analysis of data is crucial to understanding how to improve, create and guide products and services across the globe. The techniques we use to model and manipulate data guide the political, financial and social decisions that shape our modern society and are the basis of growth of the economy and success of businesses. Technology is growing and evolving at incredible speed, and the rate of growth both of data we generate and the devices we use to process it can only increase.

Our MSci Mathematics and Data Science is an Integrated Masters course that covers key skills in mathematics and data science, allowing you to apply theory and methods to real world problems. You will foster your understanding of mathematics, develop skills to use smart devices efficiently, and use statistical techniques and methods to interpret and exploit big data.

Programming skills are crucial to managing processes and databases, analysing data sets, and developing data processing pipelines. This course introduces you to Python and R for statistical analysis and data visualisation. In the latter years of your degree, you will undertake a Capstone project, applying the techniques you've learned to a data science topic of your choice.

Topics include:

* mathematical skills including applied mathematics, pure mathematics and optimisation* computer science and programming* statistics and operations research* artificial intelligence, databases and information retrieval* ethical issues around the use and processing of data* specialist skills in the areas of big data, data analytics and data science

Our Integrated Masters gives you the opportunity to fast-track your degree and complete your final year in nine months, compared to a regular MSc which usually takes twelve months. Combining your undergraduate and postgraduate study in one degree gives you a strong theoretical background as well as specialist expertise through independent research. This combination makes graduates from our course attractive candidates for many employers.

Our interdisciplinary research recognises that mathematics, including what can be very abstract mathematics, is an essential part of research in many other disciplines. You can therefore gain an exceptional range of knowledge and skills that are currently in demand in mathematically-oriented employment:

* business* commerce* industry* government service* education* wider economy

Why we're great.

* You have access to our ultramodern facilities at our STEM Centre.
* We’re ranked 25th in UK for mathematics (The Guardian University Guide 2025).
* 86% of Essex graduates are in employment or further study (Graduate Outcomes 2024).

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY

Machine Learning

(15 CREDITS)

Humans can often perform a task extremely well (e.g., telling cats from dogs) but are unable to understand and describe the decision process followed. Without this explicit knowledge, we cannot write computer programs that can be used by machines to perform the same task. “Machine learning” is the study and application of methods to learn such algorithms automatically from sets of examples, just like babies can learn to tell cats from dogs simply by being shown examples of dogs and cats by their parents. Machine learning has proven particularly suited to cases such as optical character recognition, dictation software, language translators, fraud detection in financial transactions, and many others.

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY

Applied Regression and Experimental Data Analysis

(15 CREDITS)

This module is concerned with the application of regression models to the analysis of data. The underlying assumptions will be discussed and general results are obtained using matrices. You will be introduced to the standard approach to the analysis of normally distributed data using ANOVA, as well as the methods for the design and analysis of efficient experiments. The general methodology is extended to nonlinear regression, generalised regression and the analysis of multidimensional contingency tables.

### Teaching

* Undergraduate students in the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science typically attend three taught hours per module per week. This varies by module, e.g. two hours of lectures and one class/lab.* A significant amount of practical lab work will need undertaking for written assignments and as part of your learning.* Take a mathematics careers and employability module, where you compile a portfolio of skills and experience.

### Assessment

* Your final mark is a weighted combination of coursework and summer examinations.* Your first year of study does not count towards your final degree class.* You receive regular feedback through in-term tests.

## Fees and funding

### Home/UK fee

£9,535 per year

### International fee

£21,525 per year

Fees will increase for each academic year of study.

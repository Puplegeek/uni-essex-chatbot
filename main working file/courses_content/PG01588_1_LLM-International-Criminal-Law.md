International Criminal Law

Start date:

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Essex Law School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/law)

Every day we hear about new atrocities and mass crimes in all parts of the world. Increasingly, efforts are underway to ensure that the perpetrators of these acts are brought to justice.

The LLM International Criminal Law provides students with a concentrated opportunity to study with leading experts with both practice-based and academic expertise in International Criminal Law. Students will study all facets of issues pertaining to achieving international justice and preventing impunity, across a wide range of specialist modules covering substantive and procedural aspects of international criminal law, and transnational criminal law.

The field of International Criminal Law, with its historical antecedents in the Nuremberg Tribunal and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, both established at the end of the Second World War, has been fundamentally transformed in recent decades with the establishment of the International Criminal Court, the creation of numerous ad hoc and specialised tribunals to address mass crimes in a variety of countries including Cambodia, Sierra Leone, the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and the resort to international crimes prosecutions by national courts around the world.

These proceedings continue to be practically and procedurally challenging to pursue. They are also politically sensitive, both domestically, regionally and internationally, and involve crucial debates about the appropriate placement of justice in international peace and security. Yet international criminal law proceedings are crucial avenues to justice for victims and important tools to end impunity for some of the worst crimes the world has experienced.

As a student of the LLM International Criminal Law, you will have the opportunity to become technically capable in this area and to enhance your analytical, communication and advocacy skills needed to operate effectively in the specialist field of International Criminal Law. You will learn about the different actors involved in international criminal law proceedings, and how they interact in the different phases of a case. You will learn about professional ethics and fair trial considerations as they apply to international criminal law proceedings and will gain experience of crafting legal arguments. You will also learn about evidentiary matters, and in particular what evidence is required to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that a particular international crime has taken place.

Throughout the degree you will have the opportunity to study key areas, including the substantive contents of international criminal law as well as a practice-based module on international criminal law advocacy and litigation. In this way, you will learn about litigating grave international crimes, both from a legal and procedural perspective. As part of the degree, you will also be required to research and write a dissertation on a topic linked to International Criminal Law. The dissertation is normally between 12-15,000 words. Supervision and guidance are provided.

Students will also have the opportunity to consider how the legal principles interact with wider historical, political, philosophical, sociological approaches. Students will also benefit from the Law School's wider offerings in other relevant subjects, including human rights law, international humanitarian law, transitional justice, and public international law. Therefore, you will be able to tailor your LLM to your own specific interests and requirements.

The degree will develop your intellectual and critical faculties, encourage you to think independently and teach you to present rational, coherent and accurate arguments orally and in writing. It will provide you with an excellent foundation for a wide range of careers.

This course is also available on a part-time basis (24 months). Please note that any students who require sponsorship for a Student visa to study in the UK will not be able to undertake the part-time course, in accordance with Home Office regulations.

Why we're great.

* Tailor your LLM to your own specific interests and requirements.
* We are ranked 3rd in the UK for research power in Law (THE research power measure, REF2021) and are 47th for Law in the THE World University Rankings (2023).

## Structure

### Course structure

We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of core/compulsory modules, and optional modules chosen from lists.

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

International Criminal Law 2: Advocacy and Litigation

(15 CREDITS)

This module equips students with a well-developed understanding of the procedural aspects of international criminal law and imparts practical legal and advocacy skills and techniques to them which they can use in international criminal proceedings or similar professional settings.
The module provides an in-depth overview of how international criminal law proceedings are initiated as well as their trajectory from the earliest phases to the ultimate conclusion of a case (including the conduct of investigations, arrest warrants, pre-trial, trial, appeal proceedings, sentencing and reparations). It canvasses the different roles of the prosecution, defence, victims, states, and the judiciary in such proceedings and provides a detailed analysis of the different legal and policy issues that arise throughout the proceedings and how these are addressed before international criminal courts and tribunals.
Significantly, students will participate in practical exercises such as witness examination and/or cross-examination, and orally presenting legal arguments. Through this experiential learning, they will practice putting their knowledge into effect and gain confidence implementing professional skills. The module is taught by specialists in procedural law, who have experience in the practice of law and advocacy before institutions and courts applying international criminal law.

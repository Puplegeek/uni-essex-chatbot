## Overview

The details

Course: 
Actuarial Science

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
4 - 5 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science)

An Integrated PhD provides a route into research study if you do not have a Masters degree, or have very little research training. It enables you to spend your first year completing a Masters-level qualification, followed by a full-time PhD studied over three to four years. We also offer a [‘standard' PhD](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pr01041/1/phd-actuarial-science) in this subject which can be studied either full-time (three to four years) or part-time (six to seven years).

Actuaries provide assessments of financial security systems, with a focus on their complexity, their mathematics, and their mechanisms. Actuaries quantify the probability and manage the risk of future events in areas such as insurance, healthcare, pensions, investment, and banking and also in non-financial areas.

The first year of our Integrated PhD Actuarial Science is based on the syllabus of the majority of the Core Technical subjects of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, so you cover Core Technical subjects as part of your course (CT2 or CT3, depending on the optional module selected, CT4, CT5, CT6, and CT8). This focus on up-to-date research findings in actuarial methodologies and actuarial applications means that you gain a solid training in actuarial modelling and actuarial analysis.

In your second year, you move into the PhD element of the course. We have staff members available to act as supervisors across a number of areas, such as:

* survival analysis* forensic economics* risk management* Islamic finance and takaful* asset-liability management for pension funds* predictability of financial time series* and performance evaluation of funds

You are also invited to contact our School to discuss other potential research areas.

All University of Essex research students have access to our innovative and unique scheme, [Proficio](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/proficio). Postgraduate research students are automatically enrolled on Proficio, which provides a variety of training courses, and a fund of up to £2,500 per student for conference attendance and relevant external training courses.

Why we're great.

* Our School is ranked 31st for research power in the Research Excellence Framework 2021.
* In your first year, study the majority of the Core Technical subjects of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
* Our School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science has an internationally excellent reputation in areas such as algebraic geometry, group theory, semigroup theory, differential equations, optimisation, probability, applied statistics, bioinformatics, and mathematical biology.

### Our expert staff

As well as being world-class academics, many of [our academics](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science/people/academic) have won research awards and grants from some of the largest actuarial society's worldwide, national or regional awards for lecturing, and many of them are qualified and accredited teachers.

Teaching on our course are expert academics and practising actuaries. The key departmental contacts for our MSc Actuarial Science are:

* [Professor Spyridon Vrontos](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/VRONT59308): actuarial and financial data science, predictive modelling, and predictability* [Dr Junlei Hu](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/HUJUN79707): reinsurance and optimal risk transfer* [Dr Peng Liu](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/LIUPE51704): applied probability and queueing systems* [Dr Jackie Wong](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/WONGS11905): Bayesian methods and survival analysis* [Dr John O'Hara](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/OHARA61509): financial mathematics and machine learning in finance

Our staff are strongly committed to research and teaching. They have published several well-regarded text books and are world leaders in their specialisms, with their papers appearing in learned journals such as *Journal of the Operational Research Society, The North American Journal of Economics and Finance, Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, Scandinavian Actuarial Journal, ASTIN Bulletin, North American Actuarial Journal*, and *Journal of Banking & Finance*.

### Specialist facilities

* The School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science is based in the University's state-of-the-art STEM Centre.* Unique to Essex is our renowned [Maths Support Centre](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/students/study-resources/tdc/maths/default.aspx), which offers help to students, staff and local businesses on a range of mathematical problems. Throughout term-time, we can chat through mathematical problems either on a one-to-one or small group basis.* Research students have a dedicated work space and PCs, with access to software such as MATLAB, Gap, SageMath, Python and R* We have our own computer labs for the exclusive use of students in the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science – in addition to your core maths modules, you gain computing knowledge of software including MATLAB and Maple.* We host events and seminars throughout the year.

### Your future

It has been predicted by the US Department of Labor that the employment of actuaries is expected to grow faster than any other occupation, making it a great prospect for a graduate job.

Aside from a rewarding career as an actuary, clear thinkers are required in every profession, so the successful mathematician has an extensive choice of potential careers. The [Council for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.mathscareers.org.uk/career-profiles)  offers further information on careers in mathematics.

Many of our former PhD students have gone on to work as academics in prominent institutions across the world, such as the University of Cambridge, University of Nottingham and many other international universities. Some have also remained at the University of Essex, working as postdoctoral research fellows, research impact officers, or lecturers.

Other graduates have joined organisations like the Met Office, the Ministry of Defence, and companies based in the City of London. There is a high demand for those with a numerate background in all sectors of the economy, so our graduates are sought after in the UK and abroad.

We also work with the University's Careers Services to help you find out about further work experience, internships, placements, and voluntary opportunities.

### English language requirements

If English is not your first language , we require IELTS 6.0, or equivalent with a minimum of 5.5 in all other components.

## Structure

### Course structure

Most of our taught courses combine compulsory and optional modules, giving you freedom to pursue your own interests. All of the modules listed below provide an example of what is on offer from the current academic year. Our Programme Specification provides further details of the course structure for the current academic year.

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.

The research element of your degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

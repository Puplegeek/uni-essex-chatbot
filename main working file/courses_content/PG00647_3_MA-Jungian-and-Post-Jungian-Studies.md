Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

[Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychosocial-and-psychoanalytic-studies)

**This is an online version of our MA Jungian and Post-Jungian Studies.**

This course is taught through distance learning meaning the entire course is taught online with no face-to-face, in-person teaching (This applies to both the full and part-time variant.) You will graduate with the same qualification as our campus-based MA, the only difference being you will attend all teaching virtually and not on campus. We also offer an on-campus [in-person version](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg00647/1/ma-jungian-and-post-jungian-studies) of this course.

Whether you are looking to improve your prospects of training as a Jungian analyst or psychotherapist, or learn the skills to carry out research in a related area of analytical psychology, our unique and internationally acclaimed MA Jungian and Post-Jungian Studies will give you a deep academic grounding in Jungian and post-Jungian theory and practice.

By completing the MA course, you will develop key employability skills including thinking analytically, effective essay-writing, research methods in analytical psychology and a broader understanding of depth psychological thinking, applicable to clinical and academic work. Our course could lead you to study for a PhD in Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies/Jungian and Post-Jungian Studies or to work in clinical or non-clinical settings.

Topics covered on the course include:

* The history of analytical psychology, including key contributions made by women* Intellectual precursors to, and influences on, Jung's psychology* Key Jungian and Post-Jungian texts* The role and place of mythology in Jung's thinking* Jung's psychology of religion* Central Jungian concepts, their clinical utility and their relevance in a contemporary context* The applicability of Jung's thought to other academic disciplines* The utility of Jung's psychology to understanding culture and society

Our Pre-Sessional course in ‘Basic Jungian Concepts' allows you to start our MA course with a firm foundation in Jungian concepts.

Why we're great.

* Work with leading academics from across the spectrum of Jungian theory and practice
* Free access to an optional online pre-sessional course focusing on Jungian and Post-Jungian Studies
* We take an interdisciplinary approach with links to sociology, philosophy, literature and business

### Our expert staff

Our Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies is internationally recognised as one of the leading departments for work that focuses on the role of the unconscious mind in mental health, as well as in culture and society generally. Our research and teaching is deeply grounded in knowledge deriving from clinical practice, to which our highest standards of academic thinking are then applied. You will gain the opportunity to work with and be taught by senior clinicians and world-class scholars in their fields.

### Specialist facilities

If you are studying within our Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies, you will have access to our extensive facilities to aid your learning and research. In particular, our Albert Sloman Library is well stocked with books, journals, electronic resources and major archives relevant to our work and, in addition, we have our own library of specialist books and journals.

We hold free evening Open Seminars on topics relevant to psychoanalysis which are open to students, staff and members of the public.

### Your future

Our graduates go on to a number of different destinations, including further study and training in psychoanalysis, Jungian analysis, or psychoanalytic psychotherapy.

Many of our students are already professionals, clinical and non-clinical, so return to their existing fields, either in jobs or further training, and use study with us to deepen their understanding of their work.

> "This course provided me with a good, solid understanding of Jungian theory and practice and its application from a psychosocial perspective. I particularly liked that we were constantly challenged to consider Jungian psychology from a critical and reflective perspective which has proven to be beneficial in my training as a Jungian analyst. I think the course enabled me to have a more objective and balanced analytical attitude than otherwise would have been the case."
>
> Nicholas, MA Jungian and Post-Jungian Studies

The University uses academic selection criteria to determine an applicant’s ability to
successfully complete a course at the University of Essex. Where appropriate, we may ask
for specific information relating to previous modules studied or work experience.

## Structure

### Course structure

This online course is taught through distance learning, meaning all classes and meetings will be virtual.

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The following modules are based on the current course structure and may change in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

### Study abroad

Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.

Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.

If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university

### Placement year

Alternatively, you can spend your third year on a [placement year](http://www.essex.ac.uk/careers/placements/default.aspx) with an external sporting organisation. These yearly placements allow students to gain much needed hands on experience that will set them apart in the job market.

We have close associations with many sporting clubs, examples of placement opportunities include:

* Essex Cricket. Our students have been involved in remote coding of the 2nd team and academy games from the ground at Chelmsford, live coding Women's XI and live coding some premier league cricket on Saturdays to assist the scouting department and identify local talent for the academy and EPP programme.
* Tottenham Hotspur. Our students have worked with the club as part of its academy sports science staff. Tottenham's staff also provide invited lectures to our students.
* Ipswich Town FC. Our students have had opportunities working with video analysis and GPS tracking data.

If you complete a placement year you'll only pay 20% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. Please check with the placement organiser as some of these placements can be arranged in 12 week blocks, allowing non-placement year students the same opportunities.

The [Human Performance Unit (HPU)](http://www.humanperformanceunit.co.uk/) has been used by professional athletes and sports persons from a range of disciplines, including Team GB athletes participating in the London 2012, Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Olympics, and players from our local Colchester United Football Club.

The HPU supports student teaching and research across all degree types. Our undergraduates in sports therapy, sports performance and coaching, and sports and exercise science use the HPU for some of their modules, with both beginners and professional sports persons recruited to take part. This gives students experience in managing the practical physiological tests, as well helping them develop soft skills such as communication and teamwork.

Additionally the HPU supports a range of placement activities. Undergraduate students have the option to use the HPU during our optional Placement Year, while our Masters students can take a 12-week placement. Along with continuing the work with individual athletes, students who have a placement year as part of their course also assist with sports science workshops held at the HPU for local schools. These workshops are tailored to the National Curriculum for PE, and give our students experience of working with teachers and young people.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

Employing a hybrid approach, you will be introduced to a range of performance analysis and skill acquisition principles, before applying these in practice to effectively quantify and analyse performance, and inform and reflect on coaching practice.
You are tasked with quantifying physical, technical, and tactical aspects of performance in order to facilitate athlete and team development.
You will also develop your skills to capture real-time data during performance and enhance your knowledge and understanding of how one might adjust the coaching practice accordingly depending on the desired output/aims for that session.
You will develop the necessary skills to feedback and communicate effectively with key stakeholders in the coaching process, from athletes and coaches to the wider sports science team.

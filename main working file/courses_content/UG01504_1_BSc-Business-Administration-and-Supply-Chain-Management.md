UCAS code: 
N111

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration:

Southend Campus

Based in: 
[Essex Business School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-business-school)

In the current global business landscape, understanding main functional areas of an organisation and the relationship among these functional areas will play a crucial role in efficiently managing an organisation. Effective co-ordination of internal processes and external partners (like suppliers) ensures a smooth flow of goods and services to the right consumer at the right time. A dysfunctional supply chain could significantly impact performance and could lead to increased product cost, delayed deliveries, and unsatisfied consumers.

Recent examples of supply chain crises (e.g. disruption in goods delivery, food shortages in several countries etc.), have reinforced the need to understand supply chain challenges and their impact on different functional units of an organisation.

BSc Business Administration and Supply Chain Management is designed to develop your knowledge and skillset and to teach you to critically understand an organisation's different functions and the supply chain's role in successfully managing an organisation.

The course will provide comprehensive knowledge of both theoretical and practical aspects of business and supply chain management, and prepare students to apply this learning in the context of real-world problems.

Study areas include:

* business strategy
* operations and supply chain management
* business analytics
* quantitative analysis
* logistics management
* project management
* business research methods

Group work tasks develop your teamwork skills and our business simulation project puts you in charge of your virtual venture. In competition with other students, you develop your problem-solving, analysis, and creativity skills as you make decisions to optimise your business' performance.

In your final year, you'll put your knowledge into practice by producing a business plan, industry report or dissertation in an area of your choice. As well as developing the research and analytical skills needed for the workplace, you can benefit from the opportunity to make valuable business connections by gathering case studies and interviews.

The University of Essex is one of just three UK universities to have received [Q-Step Affiliate](https://www.essex.ac.uk/about/faculty-of-social-sciences/q-step) status, including for our BSc Business Administration and Supply Chain Management, to support the way we develop the quantitative skills of our graduates.

We encourage our students to think strategically, act responsibly, and have the confidence to innovate to make positive changes in turbulent economic environments.

Components and modules explained

| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

* social psychology and individual differences* experiencing emotion* promoting health, exercise, and active lifestyles* psychological skills and strategies for improving sports performance

For aspiring sports and exercise psychologists, you would study a course accredited by the British Psychological Society (BPS), whose graduate membership is a crucial starting point for your career as a qualified psychologist and a prerequisite for many BPS-accredited postgraduate and doctoral programmes.

This course sits within our [School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences) (SRES) and splits your studies equally with our [Department of Psychology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology). This provides a unique opportunity to join communities focused on both psychology and sport and exercise science, allowing us to bring together our research, share knowledge and enhance your opportunities. You will be based in our state-of-the-art Sport Arena, benefiting from a range of facilities and dedicated laboratories for research.

### Study abroad

Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.

Studying abroadÂ allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course.Â A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules fromÂ which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: CORE

Understanding our place in the world

(15 CREDITS)

This module will explore questions such as: Is intelligence fixed? Is our memory reliable? How do we learn? By introducing a range of approaches from across psychology, you will address such questions from different perspectives and provide the foundations needed to become a successful Essex student. This module will also begin your training on designing and carrying out psychology experiments, and dealing with the information that those experiments provide.

[View Understanding our place in the world on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS101&year=25)

COMPONENT 02: CORE

Growing in the world

(15 CREDITS)

New-borns are totally dependent on others. They are unable to move or sit up; they cannot reach out and pick up an object; their vision is poor; they cannot even express simple emotions. By the end of the developmental process, some 20 years later, humans have become the most psychologically complex things we know. How does this happen? This module will introduce you to how humans grow and develop in the world. The principal approaches to the study of human development will be discussed, with a particular focus on how infants take their first "psychological steps" in the social world. You will also develop the research and analysis skills that are needed to answer different questions about how humans grow in the world.

[View Growing in the world on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS102&year=25)

COMPONENT 03: CORE

Experiencing Emotion

(15 CREDITS)

In this module you will discover answers to fundamental questions in the science of emotion: What are emotions and why do we have them? Is it possible to elicit specific emotions in people and measure them? How good are we at sensing how someone else is feeling? Why are some people more emotional than others? You'll untangle the complexities involved in studying human emotion by: exploring a variety of research methods and measurements, applying critical thinking to psychological concepts, and mastering the data analysis techniques that allow psychologists to draw conclusions about our experience of emotion.

[View Experiencing Emotion on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS103&year=25)

COMPONENT 04: CORE

Thinking and the Mind

(15 CREDITS)

In this module, you'll study the internal mental processes that go on inside our brain that form the basis of our thoughts. We'll answer questions such as: what do visual illusions tell us about how we perceive the world? Are we really able to multi-task? How do we understand and produce speech, and is this different if you speak more than one language? You will learn the skills that psychologists use to conduct research to answer these questions, as well as core theories and knowledge about key topics in this area.

[View Thinking and the Mind on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS104&year=25)

COMPONENT 05: CORE

The Social World

(15 CREDITS)

Do you behave differently when you are alone than with others? How do people interact with individuals? How do they behave in groups? How do people explain the social world and how do they explain the behaviour of others? What makes people attribute human characteristics to animals and inanimate objects? This module will examine how humans live in and interact with the social world. These questions will be explored, using social psychology theories, survey methods and research skills.

[View The Social World on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS105&year=25)

COMPONENT 06: CORE

The Social Brain

(15 CREDITS)

How does your brain decide between good and bad? What is the neural basis of moral reasoning? What is the biological basis of anger and aggression? Can we explain psychopathy in terms of differences in brain structure and function? What can neuroscience tell us about whether people should be held accountable for their actions? These are the kinds of the questions that we will investigate in this module, which aims to understand the neural basis of (anti) social behaviour. These questions will be addressed by building knowledge and understanding whilst also developing the skills that psychologists use to research these aspects of human behaviour.

[View The Social Brain on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS106&year=25)

COMPONENT 07: COMPULSORY

Sport and Exercise Psychology

(15 CREDITS)

Is it all in the mind? The margin between victory and defeat is thin, but can an athleteâs psychology really give them an edge? Why do some people find exercise difficult and other find exercise essential? Understanding how involvement in sport, exercise and physical activity affects a person's health and wellbeing is important in creating better interventions. The aim of this module is to introduce you to the fundamental principles underpinning the psychology of sport and exercise.

[View Sport and Exercise Psychology on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=SE104&year=25)

Brain and Behaviour

(15 CREDITS)

The brain is an extremely complex organ, and there is much that we still have to learn about its processes and functions. This module will detail the psychological mechanisms that underlie human behaviour and highlight the possibility that even our deepest thoughts and feelings arise from electrical and chemical activity in our brains.

COMPONENT 04: CORE

Cognitive Psychology

(15 CREDITS)

This module explores the basic cognitive processes involved in thinking about the world, interacting with the world, and experiencing the world. Often as users of these processes they just work and the complexity of the underlying operations are hidden; a kind of "user illusion". You will learn about the emerging scientific picture of how these basic processes operate, thereby gaining a better appreciation of the underlying complexity, and a renewed appreciation of the brilliance of these operations. The module will consider examples of human talents; such as bilingualism, as well as human limitations, such as our working memory capacities. The module will cover core areas of cognition as defined by the British Psychological Society such as perception, mental imagery, attention, memory, language, and consciousness. These will be discussed both with reference to laboratory-based experiments, and also how these processes may be disrupted and may breakdown in various conditions, such as dyslexia, amnesia, and other neuropsychological conditions. Finally, the lectures will address how basic cognitive processes apply to complex real-world behaviours.

COMPONENT 05: CORE

Health and Active Lifestyle

(15 CREDITS)

Physical activity is very important to wellbeing and health. We will discuss why not everyone is meeting the minimum recommendations for physical activity and then critically examine why interventions or initiatives to increase physical activity are successful. Behaviour change theories and techniques will be explored which may increase physical activity in the individual and community. This module gives you the chance to write a critical essay on behaviour change and a novel infographic designed to communicate the benefits of physical activity on our health. Classes will include debates, open tutorials, labs and some standard lectures.
This module has been designed to enable students to integrate their subject knowledge with an understanding of sustainable development, acquiring the skills and competencies essential for addressing the urgent sustainability challenges of the 21stÂ century.

Environments Shape Physical Activity: Translating Research into Practice

(15 CREDITS)

Drawing from several disciplines this module will consider topical issues relating to the effectiveness of physical activity interventions across the life course on a range of health and wellbeing outcomes. It will explore how evidence-based physical activity initiatives and interventions in different environments and settings shape behaviour. There is a growing demand for practitioners to critically evaluate the current evidence-base and gain an understanding of how this knowledge can be translated to inform their applied professional practice. The module will afford opportunities to engage with cutting edge research and develop transferable communication skills in translating research findings into executive summaries that can be used and understood by a range of audiences.

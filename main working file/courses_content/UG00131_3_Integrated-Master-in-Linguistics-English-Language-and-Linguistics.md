Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Language and Linguistics](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/language-and-linguistics)

Language is fundamental to our thoughts, our relationships, and our civilisations. Through language, we transmit knowledge, from inviting someone for coffee, to promoting the latest scientific theory, to settling global political disputes.

This course will allow you to explore a variety of aspects of linguistics up to a very high level of expertise. In your first year, you will be acquainted with some of the fundamental aspects of the study of language, such as the description and analysis of sounds, words and sentences, the investigation of language in its social setting, and how language is situated and develops in the mind and in the brain.

You also have the opportunity to begin a specialism in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL). In the second year, you begin to specialise towards those areas that you are most interested in and, if your specialism includes TEFL, you will learn how to design, deliver and evaluate language classes and assessments. You then have the option of taking the third year to go abroad or do a placement year. In your third year (if you continue with your studies without this option) or the fourth (if you do spend a year on one of these activities), you will develop your specialism further and be acquainted with the cutting edge of current research in your area. You will also do an independent research project under the guidance and supervision of one of our expert members of staff, and write a dissertation about this project.

In the final year, you will take a number of modules from our Postgraduate offering, in order to further develop your chosen area of specialism. You will receive further training on research methods, and be able to conduct small-scale research projects, using our state-of-the art lab facilities (including eye tracking, EEG, sound analysis and reaction time paradigms).

Why we're great.

* You can learn a modern language as part of your course
* You'll have the opportunity to study a certificate in Teaching English as a Foreign Language as part of your degree.
* 6th for linguistics for overall positivity score (National Student Survey 2024, English broad- discipline higher education institutions)

### Study abroad

Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The five-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the four-year course. Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.

You will pay 15% tuition fees to Essex for your year abroad year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university.

### Placement year

Alternatively, you can spend your third year on a [placement year](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/careers/placements/default.aspx) with an external organisation, where you learn about a particular sector, company or job role, apply your academic knowledge in a practical working environment, and receive inspiration for future career pathways. You will be responsible for finding your placement, but with support and guidance provided by both your department and our Employability and Careers Centre.

If you complete a placement year you'll only pay 20% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year.

### Our expert staff

[Our staff](https://www.essex.ac.uk/%E2%80%9Dhttps:/www.essex.ac.uk/departments/language-and-linguistics/people/academic%E2%80%9D) maintain excellent student-staff ratios with capped language-specific seminars.

In theoretical linguistics, Kyle Jerro and Hannah Gibson work on the structure of words and sentences, focusing on English and other languages. Scott Lewis and Nancy Kula work on sound structure.

In sociolinguistics, Rebecca Clift, Enam Al Wer, Ella Jeffries and Amanda Cole all work on different aspects of how language varies, and investigate which factors cause such variation.

In applied linguistics, Karen Roehr-Brackin and Adela Gánem-Gutiérrez focus on the learning of second and further languages, whilst Tracey Costley, Christina Gkonou, Neophytos Mitsigkas and Nasser Jabbari focus on issues to do with the classroom teaching of English as a foreign language.

In psycholinguistics, Claire Delle Luche and Laurie Lawyer use experimental techniques such as eyetracking and EEG to understand how children learn language, how adults process language, and what happens when language ability is impaired by brain disorders or other factors (e.g. hearing impairment).

In all of these areas, we combine a theoretical approach with high-level, qualitative and quantitative, empirical and experimental technique; in particular, we have a strong interest in recent developments in inferential statistics.

### Specialist facilities

The study of linguistics provides the opportunity for plenty of hands-on experience as well as theoretical work. You might be?listening to interviews, studying language processing, or analysing sounds, so we provide extensive facilities to allow you to fully engage with a wide variety of linguistic methods:

* Our Eye-Tracking Lab has equipment for monitoring response times and eye movements when individuals are presented with pictures and videos* Our Psycholinguistics Lab has computing facilities for measuring how long it takes individuals to react to words, texts and sounds* Our Psycholinguistics Lab measures how long it takes individuals to react to words, texts and sounds* Our Linguistics Lab, where we run behavioural experiments* Our EEG Lab is used for recording brain activity during reading, listening, or watching video of language materials
          Within our department, we also offer:* An exciting programme of research seminars and other events* Our Albert Sloman Library houses a strong collection of books, journals, electronic resources and major archives* Our Languages for All programme offers you the opportunity to study an additional language alongside your course at no extra cost* Meet other language enthusiasts through our student-run Linguistics Society

### Your future

Studying language and linguistics allows you to develop your research and IT skills by collecting and analysing linguistic data using state-of-the-art technology, and a combination of team-work and independent projects enhances your communication, problem-solving, and management skills.

However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

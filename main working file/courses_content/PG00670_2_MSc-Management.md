Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY

Management and Strategy

(20 CREDITS)

This module is designed to encourage students to reflect on a variety of issues relating to management and business strategy. It will introduce students to the basics of management such as dealing with teams, culture and organisational management structures. It will then introduce students to managing strategically, covering topics that involve the analysis of the external and internal environments of the business as well as avenues for implementation.
Consequently, the module offers an insight into a range of current business issues, management dilemmas, ethical considerations, and general governance issues relating to the strategic direction of organisations. Overall, the module provides an introduction to management and strategy and a critical examination of its application in practice.

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY

Organisational Behaviour and Human Resource Management

(20 CREDITS)

This module is designed to encourage students to think and reflect upon the nature of managing people and organisations. In particular, it encourages students to consider the main topics of Organisational Behaviour and Human Resource Management. Throughout the sessions, the core issues affecting organisational behaviour and outcomes will be discussed and critically analysed. Therefore, it invites participants to consider the tensions emerging from competing views and perspectives. In so doing, the module challenges many of the taken-for-granted assumptions about people management, and provides tools to analyse organisations and to explore the realities of organisational life.

(20 CREDITS)

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY

Research Methods in Management

(20 CREDITS)

This module introduces students to the methodology and methods of research in the field of Management. Students are acquainted with the nature of the philosophical assumptions that underpin the choice of research design, in particular case studies for data collection and analysis. The module explores a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods to illustrate the suitability of these methods for designing research projects. The ethical, practical and legal questions raised by research are explored. Practical aspects of the research process are examined including the skills required to evaluate published research, organise and undertake a research project within the body of relevant knowledge, and make practical and actionable recommendations.

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY

International Management

(20 CREDITS)

Business is international in scope as managers take advantage of the comparative advantages countries around the world offer through complex and geographic dispersed value chains, not only to sell products but also to access intermediate goods, capital, knowledge and skills. This module, built around a live, practical project addresses several questions. 'How can a domestic firm internationalise its operations?' 'How are its resources and capabilities challenged and transformed by internationalisation?' 'What factors determine the success of an international business operation?' While many practical examples are provided, focus is given to developing an analytical approach to addressing these questions, drawing on two perspectives. These are the Resource-based view, which focuses on the resources and capabilities of the firm, and the Institution-based view which requires studying the differences in the business environment around the globe, to which successful companies need to adapt. The module considers political, economic and cultural difference and the strategies companies adopt when conducting business across national boundaries. Through the group project, students analyse the internationalisation of a real life organisation, identifying the purpose of internationalisation, selecting the most appropriate target market and considering the various means available to the firm to internationalise its operations. Topical issues in international business are also discussed towards the end of the module, such as the impact of Brexit on the trading relationship of the UK, the re-emergence of emerging market MNEs, 'born global' firms and the fourth industrial revolution.

COMPONENT 07: COMPULSORY

Managing Across Cultures

(20 CREDITS)

Managers increasingly find themselves working across borders calling for a thorough understanding of issues that relate to cross cultural management. In this course you enhance your understanding of the way in which globalisation and international business activities affect management and management practices across cultures.

To be competitive in our modern financial industry, it is not enough for a scientist to know how to write software, nor is it enough that one can mathematically analyse markets based on simplifying assumption by ignoring the computation required.

Our MSc Financial Technology (Computer Science) course gives you an understanding of the specifics and the intricacies of financial and economics markets, the ability to apply advanced computing methods, and the ability to design and program solutions that successfully exploit the synergy between finance, economics, and computation.

Our course covers areas including:

* financial markets* big data analytics* blockchain* AI* python programming

Our course will give you both the theoretical and technical skills that are specific to the finance industry, as well as transferable skills such as the ability to develop and present an argument, and the ability to work independently and in groups.

The MSc Financial Technology suite of courses has three unique variants for you to explore, so you can tailor your Masters in financial technology to suit your interests and goals. In addition to our MSc Financial Technology (Computer Science) course, there is also the option of [MSc Financial Technology (Finance)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg01380/1/msc-financial-technology-finance) and [MSc Financial Technology (Economics)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg01381/1/msc-financial-technology-economics), giving you the chance to specialise in your preferred area of study.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course.Â A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules fromÂ which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

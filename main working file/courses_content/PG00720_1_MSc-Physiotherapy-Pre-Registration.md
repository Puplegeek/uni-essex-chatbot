Physiotherapy is a science-based health care profession committed to extending, applying, evaluating, and reviewing the evidence that underpins and informs its practice. Physiotherapists adopt a ‘whole person' approach to maximise the potential of a person's function and movement. Thus, physiotherapists not only help people stay independent for as long possible after illness or injury, but also help maintain health for people of all ages, preventing disease and managing pain.

Patient involvement is at the core of this approach and, as such, key attributes a physiotherapist must possess include the ability to empower, relate, and educate people to facilitate change in their health and wellbeing. Physiotherapists are autonomous professionals, able to act as first-contact practitioners, as well as accepting referrals from other health care professionals. Consequently, central to physiotherapy practice is clinical judgement and informed interpretation of clinical information.

Physiotherapists are also professionals who work in increasingly complex environments. At Essex, we produce graduates who demonstrate effective problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, underpinned by a sound physiotherapy knowledge base and appropriate professional skills. To succeed, you will possess self-directed learning habits that will enable you to continue as a reflective practitioner and lifelong learner, maintaining your fitness to practise throughout your career.

Our full-time MSc Physiotherapy (Pre-Registration) course is studied over two years and is designed as a continuous progression of integrated theory and practice, emphasising students being proactive partners in their learning experiences.

Our [School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences) (SRES) is a community specifically focused on sports and exercise science, sports therapy and physiotherapy. We are based in the Essex Sport Arena at the Colchester Campus and bring together internationally recognised research, knowledge and placement and vocational opportunities for our students and graduates.

#### Vaccinations

We continue to recommend COVID-19 and flu vaccinations. This is to protect yourself and the vulnerable people you may meet throughout your placement.

#### Practice-based learning opportunities

Practice-based placements are organised by our placement team and each student is timetabled to complete approximately 1,000 hours of practice-based learning. During placements, you'll work with qualified physiotherapists and other professionals to consolidate learning, gain new experiences, and develop and refine your abilities. Learning on placement is achieved through interactive experiences and practice educators facilitating personal and professional growth within a variety of settings. The environment is supportive, enabling you to rehearse skills with constructive feedback.

To maximise the learning opportunities available to you, we work with a variety of practice-based learning providers from across our region. From the Colchester Campus you may need to travel up to 90 minutes each day to and from a placement location, or use local accommodation for locations that are further afield. Eligible students are able to claim back these additional costs associated with attending placements through the [NHS business authority](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-learning-support-fund-lsf), who you can also apply to for a £5,000 per academic year grant (that you won't need to pay back!). Additional funding may also be available depending on your personal circumstances. You can find more information about eligibility and how to apply on the [Health and Social Care Scholarships and Funding page](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care/scholarships-and-funding).

You will be provided with two student physiotherapist uniform polo shirts, as well as two tunics and two pairs of trousers, prior to your first practice placement (you can also purchase additional items, if you choose).

#### Additional expenses

You will incur additional costs and expenses throughout this course, which you can learn more about in our [Additional Course-Related Expenses document](https://www.essex.ac.uk/-/media/documents/departments/sres/Physiotherapy-additional-course-related-expenses-2025-26.docx) (.doc).

> "I could not have asked for a better foundation to my career than the course at Essex, which is founded on encouraging students to be autonomous in gaining their skills and knowledge through the support of experienced teaching staff. We were always challenged to be critical of our knowledge and how it could be applied to individuals in our care. Patients being at the centre of our care underpinned all modules, which is an attitude that was invaluable in seeking and gaining employment."

### English language requirements

  

An overall IELTS score of 7.0, with 6.5 in all components.

## Structure

### Course structure

Please note that our MSc Physiotherapy (Pre-Registration) is an intensive two-year course based at our Colchester Campus.

Postgraduate study is the chance to take your education to the next level. These carefully selected modules will give you the chance to explore, question, and create powerful ideas. Picked to give you an extensive and in-depth education, they'll equip you with the specialist knowledge, vital transferrable skills, and the confidence to make a genuine difference to the world around you.

There are 44 weeks of teaching per year. The structure of the programme adopts a developmental approach to the mastering of physiotherapy skills. You will be introduced to physiotherapy through observing and working with physiotherapists practising in a variety of settings (primary and secondary care, public and private sectors, adult and the elderly, acute care setting and specialist mental health/learning disability services), and adopt a critical stand in the discussion of contemporary physiotherapy practice in the context of the environment of practice.

We're reactive, we're pioneering, we never stand still, so modules might change from year to year in response to new developments and innovation. Those listed below show how a typical course might look, but more detail on course structure, including details of all optional modules, is available on our [Programme Specification](http://www.essex.ac.uk/programmespecs).

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

### How can I demonstrate I have what it takes?

You'll notice that many of our physiotherapy pre-registration courses are underpinned by the NHS Constitution, as well as our own Essex values. The NHS Constitution is an important document which establishes the principles and values of the NHS in England.

This document very clearly explains that the patient is at the heart of everything the NHS does. We take this commitment seriously, and so are looking for people who have the potential to be future healthcare superstars. You may wish to consider this in your written application.

Our courses are a blend of both theory and practice, so we also need to hear from you about both your academic and practical skills. Think carefully about how your experiences have prepared you for some of the challenges of the course, and how they can make you stand out from the crowd. For example, if you've worked in retail, you're likely to have developed your communication skills, so you may be able to talk about this.

### My course requires an interview. What can I do to prepare?

For many people, the idea of being interviewed is quite daunting. There's no need to panic. We're on your side. We aim to use the interview process to get to know you and to find out your plans for the future.

Our interview panels are made up from current staff and students, service users/experts by experience, and local placement partners. Many of the panel will have been through a similar process at some point in their career, so they'll appreciate you'll probably be feeling nervous. Try to relax (as best as you can) and think of it more as a discussion with colleagues about why you'd like to join us.

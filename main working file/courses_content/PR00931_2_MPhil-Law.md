Our former students have gone on to work in legal practice, commerce and industry, the non-governmental organisation sector and academia, including the academic community in our Essex Law School.

We also offer an MPhil in this subject.

Please note, part-time research study is also available.

Why we're great.

* Volunteer at the Essex Law Clinic where you can work alongside practicing solicitors to offer legal advice to clients.

### Our expert staff

Within our Essex Law School, you will be allocated a supervisor whose role is to guide you through the different stages of your research degree. In some cases, you may have joint supervision by two members of our staff.

The support provided by your supervisor is a key feature of your research student experience and you will have regular one-to-one meetings to discuss progress on your research. Initially, your supervisor will help you develop your research topic and plan.

Twice a year, you will have a supervisory board meeting, which provides a more formal opportunity to discuss your progress and agree your plans for the next six months.

### Specialist facilities

Within our Essex Law School, our student Law Society run a number of activities throughout the year that you may wish to be involved in.

The Human Rights Clinic of our Human Rights Centre offers you an opportunity to become involved in human rights work. In particular, our Litigation Unit allows you to improve your litigation skills while taking part in the design of litigation strategies in a variety of cases, their litigation and the presentation of amicus curiae briefs before national and international courts. You also have an opportunity to participate in the work of our Essex Business and Human Rights Project through advocacy and consultancy work, including the preparation of policy documents and contributions to amicus curiae briefs. This is particularly recommended if you are taking our pathway in economic relations and human rights.

Our Essex Transitional Justice Network also provides you with an opportunity to take an active part in any of the interdisciplinary projects carried out by academic staff in this area, some of which are predominantly of a legal nature, such as the litigation of cases or the writing of amicus curiae briefs.

EXCCEL is a virtual centre of excellence in European legal research, focusing on knowledge exchange for policymakers engaged in European and comparative law.

### Your future

Our Essex Law School graduates have gone on to a wide variety of careers in international and intergovernmental organisations or employment with governments across the world, in commerce and banking, in non-governmental organisations and, as might be expected, in the legal profession and the judiciary.

Our large community of graduates regularly inform our current postgraduates of opportunities in their organisations and businesses.

### English language requirements

If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 6.5 overall, and 6.5 in writing, with a minimum of 5.5 remaining components

## Structure

### Course structure

A research degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

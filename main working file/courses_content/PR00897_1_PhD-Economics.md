### English language requirements

If English is not your first language, then we will require you to have IELTS 6.5 with a minimum of 5.5 in each component

## Structure

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

### Teaching

The Department provides advanced research training PhD modules in the first year of the PhD. Students must take PhD modules offered in the Autumn Term.

Starting no later than Spring Term, students are then required to work towards their dissertation research under the supervision of their dissertation supervisors. This starts with identifying a suitable research topic and plan with guidance of their supervisors.

Continuation in the PhD programme is conditional good performance in both the doctoral modules and in the research plan module and presenting the research plan in the student Research Strategy Seminar series.

We expect full-time students in this PhD programme to complete their PhD studies within four years of entering, so you are monitored regularly to ensure you are progressing.

During your thesis research period, you will have a supervisory panel meeting twice a year which provides a more formal opportunity to discuss your progress and agree your plans for the next six months. In the completion period you should be revising and rewriting chapters. You then submit your approved thesis for examination.

The support provided by your supervisors is a key feature of your experience as a research student. Your supervisors guide you through the different stages of your research degree. Initially they help you to develop your research topic and plan, and then you participate in regular individual meetings to comment on drafts, resolve problems and to maintain progress on your research.

You'll also have access to other research training opportunities via the University's unique Proficio funding scheme. In addition, the University's participation in networks such as the ESRC SeNSS DTP and Eastern ARC can provide additional opportunities for training.

The PhD programme is offered as full-time study only in the first year. It may be possible to continue studies on a part time basis from the second year onward, subject to approval.

**Professional development**

Our department offers paid opportunities for both Graduate Teaching Assistants and Research Assistants. The Proficio scheme also provides funding for professional development. We also provide career development support, especially in your final year, with practice presentations, interviews, and other activities to prepare you for the international job market for PhD economists.

### Assessment

Our department maintains a lively, friendly, and supportive atmosphere for research. We also provide a number of training opportunities and support services to aid your studies and to help prepare you for employment:

* **Proficio:** [Proficio](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/students/study-resources/research.aspx) is our innovative professional development scheme for postgraduate research students, unique to Essex. We believe that your academic and professional development is vital to your growth as a postgraduate research student and we give you funds that can be spent on a variety of courses and conferences.* **Teaching Opportunities:** Our department offers paid opportunities for both Graduate Teaching Assistants and Research Assistants.

### Dissertation

In your completion year you should be revising and rewriting chapters. You submit your approved thesis to an internal reader for comments, and then submit your final thesis before the end of the academic year.

We expect our PhD students to complete their PhD within four years of entering, so you are monitored regularly to ensure you are progressing.

## Fees and funding

### Home/UK fee

£5,006 per year

### International fee

£19,650 per year

Fees will increase for each academic year of study.

## Overview

The details

Course: 
Management (Social Economy)

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Essex Business School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-business-school)

Firms across the public, private, and third sectors are all considering how environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles should inform their business strategies. Employers across all industries are looking for innovative managers to take the lead on driving sustainability, equality and inclusion objectives to ensure their businesses are shaped for ethical growth and success.

MSc Management (Social Economy) will introduce you to the main theories and strategic perspectives associated with the ‘social economy', those organisations that promote values of sustainability, inclusivity, and equality as part of their core mission.

Most importantly, you will learn the concrete ways you can turn these theories into an empowering reality and you will have the opportunity to connect with real-life social organisations in the public, third, and community sectors.

On this course you will learn not just the theory of what a social economy means, what sustainability and fairness look like, but also how you could make these a reality within organisations you might run or work for.

MSc Management (Social Economy) is perfect if you do not have a first degree in business, or relevant work experience in management. In your first term, you will study a core portfolio of modules that give you a firm basis in management and organisational issues.

You will then move on to study specialist modules on social economy exploring issues such as:

* commons ownership
* cooperative management
* mutual aid
* and democratic decision-making

You may be an aspiring manager looking for the tools you need to implement values of sustainability, equality and local empowerment in practical ways across a range of trading markets. You may hope to work for a co-operative, a mutual, or a social enterprise and want to understand how you turn your principles into effective business strategy.

This pioneering pathway will provide you with the knowledge and skills to be a twenty-first-century global change-maker as a social economy leader.

At [Essex Business School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-business-school) we champion responsible management and sustainable business. We want to change business for the better and empower our students to do this too. We're an internationally diverse community with students and staff joining us from across the globe offering the ideal context for studying social economy management.

MSc Management (Social Economy) is one of four unique Masters in management which allow you to pursue your specific career ambitions, the others are: [MSc Management](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg00670/1/msc-management), [MSc Management (International)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg00670/2/msc-management) and  [MSc Management (Marketing).](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg00670/3/msc-management)

Why we're great.

* Understand how to turn your ethical principles into effective business strategy.
* Connect with real-life social organisations in the public, third, and community sectors to contextualise your learning.
* This course is perfect if you do not have a first degree in business, or relevant work experience in management.

### Our expert staff

Management and marketing research at [Essex Business School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-business-school) is very diverse but can best be described as exploring business with a social conscience. For example, our research investigates workplace ethics, corporate social responsibility and the lived experience of work in the global economy.

One of the academics that you may meet during your course is [Professor Peter Bloom](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/BLOOM09008/peter-bloom) , a Professor of Management at Essex Business School. His research critically explores the radical possibilities of technology for redefining and transforming contemporary work and society.

You may also hear from [Dr Nicholas Beuret](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/BEURE54507/nicholas-beuret) who is an expert on climate change, environmental politics, the transition to a low carbon economy, degrowth and the commons. He has a particular interest in the role of net zero as an organising principle for start-ups, and profiteering within the green transition economy.

The research activities of academics in our management and marketing group is supported by the  [Centre for Commons Organising, Values Equalities and Resilience (COVER)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/commons-organising-values-equalities-and-resilience). The Centre's research investigates how principles of cooperation, collaboration, and open knowledge sharing can foster more egalitarian, inclusive, and participative 21st-century economies, communities, technologies, and organisations.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

Management and Strategy

(20 CREDITS)

This module is designed to encourage students to reflect on a variety of issues relating to management and business strategy.

It will then introduce students to managing strategically, covering topics that involve the analysis of the external and internal environments of the business as well as avenues for implementation.
Consequently, the module offers an insight into a range of current business issues, management dilemmas, ethical considerations, and general governance issues relating to the strategic direction of organisations.

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY

Organisational Behaviour and Human Resource Management

(20 CREDITS)

This module is designed to encourage students to think and reflect upon the nature of managing people and organisations. In particular, it encourages students to consider the main topics of Organisational Behaviour and Human Resource Management. Throughout the sessions, the core issues affecting organisational behaviour and outcomes will be discussed and critically analysed. Therefore, it invites participants to consider the tensions emerging from competing views and perspectives. In so doing, the module challenges many of the taken-for-granted assumptions about people management, and provides tools to analyse organisations and to explore the realities of organisational life.

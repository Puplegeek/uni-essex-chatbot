Data Science

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science)

The techniques we use to model and manipulate data guide the political, financial, and social decisions that shape our modern society and are the basis of economy growth and business success. Technology is growing and evolving at an incredible speed, and the growth rate of both the data we generate and the devices we use to process it can only increase.

Data science is a growing and important field of study with an increasing number of jobs and opportunities within both the private and public sectors. The application of theory and methods to real-world problems is at the core of data science, which aims especially to use and exploit big data.

If you are interested in solving real-world problems, like to develop skills to use smart devices efficiently, want to use and to foster your understanding of mathematics, and keen to use statistical techniques and methods to interpret data, MSc Data Science at Essex is for you. You study a balance of solid theory and practical application, including:

* computer science* programming* statistics* data analysis* probability

A successful career in data science requires you to possess truly interdisciplinary knowledge, so we ensure that you graduate with a wide-ranging yet specialised set of skills in this area. You are taught mainly within our [School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science) and our [School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering), but also benefit from input from our [Essex Business School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-business-school) and our [Essex Pathways Department](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-pathways). Data scientists are required in every sector, carrying out statistical analysis or mining data on social media, so our course can open the door to almost any industry, from health, to government, to publishing.

Our School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science is genuinely innovative and student-focused. Our research groups are working on a broad range of collaborative areas tackling real-world issues.

* Our data scientists carefully consider how not to lie, and how not to get lied to with data. Interpreting data correctly is especially important because much of our data science research is applied directly or indirectly to social policies, including health, care and education.* We do practical research with financial data (for example, assessing the risk of collapse of the UK's banking system) as well as theoretical research in financial instruments such as insurance policies or asset portfolios.* We also research how physical processes develop in time and space. Applications of this range from modelling epilepsy to modelling electronic cables.* Our optimisation experts work out how to do the same job with less resource, or how to do more with the same resource.* Our pure maths group are currently working on two new funded projects entitled ‘Machine learning for recognising tangled 3D objects' and ‘Searching for gems in the landscape of cyclically presented groups'.* We also do research into mathematical education and use exciting technologies such as electroencephalography or eye tracking to measure exactly what a learner is feeling. Our research aims to encourage the implementation of ‘the four Cs' of modern education, which are critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity.

This course is available as either a full-time degree over one academic year, or as a part-time degree over two academic years. It is aimed at candidates with a background in a mathematical or computational discipline. Candidates without strong programming and statistical skills are encouraged to consider our conversion course [MSc Data Science and its Applications](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg01404/1/msc-data-science-and-its-applications). Candidates wishing to convert from a non-STEM background are encouraged to consider [MSc Applied Data Science](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg01389/1/msc-applied-data-science).

You can start this course in October or January.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

(30 CREDITS)

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY

Applied Regression and Experimental Data Analysis

(15 CREDITS)

This module is concerned with the application of regression models to the analysis of data. The underlying assumptions will be discussed and general results are obtained using matrices. You will be introduced to the standard approach to the analysis of normally distributed data using ANOVA, as well as the methods for the design and analysis of efficient experiments. The general methodology is extended to nonlinear regression, generalised regression and the analysis of multidimensional contingency tables.

[View Applied Regression and Experimental Data Analysis on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=MA717&year=25)

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY

Applied Statistics

(15 CREDITS)

In this module, you will study three application areas of statistics - multivariate methods, demography and epidemiology, and sampling, and how to apply and assess these methods in a variety of situations.

[View Applied Statistics on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=MA321&year=25)

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY

Machine Learning

(15 CREDITS)

Humans can often perform a task extremely well (e.g., telling cats from dogs) but are unable to understand and describe the decision process followed. Without this explicit knowledge, we cannot write computer programs that can be used by machines to perform the same task. “Machine learning” is the study and application of methods to learn such algorithms automatically from sets of examples, just like babies can learn to tell cats from dogs simply by being shown examples of dogs and cats by their parents. Machine learning has proven particularly suited to cases such as optical character recognition, dictation software, language translators, fraud detection in financial transactions, and many others.

[View Machine Learning on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=CE802&year=25)

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY

Data Visualisation

(15 CREDITS)

In a world increasingly driven by data, the need for analysis and visualisation is more important than ever. In this module you will look at data through the eyes of a numerical detective. You will work on the lost art of exploratory data analysis, reviewing appropriate methods for data summaries with the aim to summarise, understand, extract hidden patterns and identify relationships. You will then work on graphical data analysis, using simple graphs to understand the data, but also advanced complex methods to scrutinise data and interactive plots to communicate data information to a wider audience.
For data analysis and visualisations you will use R-studio, and a combination of R-shiny applications and google visualisations for interactive plotting.

[View Data Visualisation on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=MA304&year=25)

COMPONENT 07: COMPULSORY

Research Skills and Employability

(0 CREDITS)

What skills do you need to succeed during your studies? What about after university? How will you harness your knowledge and soft skills to realise your career goals? This module helps you take an active role in developing transferrable skills and capitalising on your unique background. As well as broad reflection on your professional development, this module will help you explore different career directions and prepare you for the application process, supported by an advisor from within the department.

## Overview

The details

Course: 
Microbiology

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
3 - 4 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Life Sciences (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/biological-sciences)

Research in our [School of Life Sciences](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences) covers a wide spectrum of biology from genes to ecosystems, and this broad-based structure provides opportunities for developing novel ideas and interdisciplinary projects. We offer supervision in a wide range of topics in microbiology, ranging from medical microbiology to environmental microbiology, and from biochemical and genomic analysis of single species to whole communities.

As a research student at Essex, you work at the heart of our internationally acknowledged, well-resourced and well-connected research community. We offer world-class supervision and training opportunities, and encourage you to engage with other researchers, professionals, practitioners, and research users, where possible - such as using the generous funding from [Proficio](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/proficio) to attend conferences and training courses.

We also offer an MSD in this area. Both part-time and full-time research study are available. You can start this degree in October, January or April.

Why we're great.

* Collaborate alongside our research groups working on important international and national problems using cutting-edge techniques.
* Become part of our collaborative Research Groups that work on important international and national problems using cutting-edge techniques, with strong links with a range of organisations such as the NHS, Public Health England, the Environment Agency, Cefas, Defra, oil companies, and Anglian Water.
* The quality of our work is reflected in the large number of publications in high-profile academic journals our staff feature in.

### Our expert staff

You will be allocated a [supervisor](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences/people) who will guide you through the different stages of your research degree. In some cases, you may have joint supervision by two members of our staff.

The support provided by your supervisor is a key feature of your research student experience, and you will have regular one-to-one meetings to discuss progress on your research. Initially, your supervisor will help you develop your research topic and plan.

Twice a year, you will have a supervisory board meeting, which provides a more formal opportunity to discuss your progress and agree your plans for the next six months.

Your technical and intellectual development will be enhanced by becoming part of a [research group](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences/research) and participating in School Seminars.

### Specialist facilities

Our School of Life Sciences provides a comprehensive range of facilities for medical and environmental microbiology research, including:

* fully automated laboratories with robotic liquid-handling systems and facilities for microbial culture, cell culture, molecular biology, gene editing and next-generation sequence analysis* an advanced bioimaging suite to visualise and process analyse images of biological processes in real time

A dedicated study room allows all our postgraduate research students to have access to a desk and a computer outside of the research laboratories. This provides a focal point for our postgraduates, facilitating reading and writing as well as good communication and a sense of community.

### Your future

Many of our postgraduates continue their scientific research by taking up postdoctoral positions in the UK and overseas. Others have embarked on [careers](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences/careers) in biomedical laboratories and in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, or governmental and non-governmental organisations. We support your career development by a mentoring scheme and employability events.

### English language requirements

If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 6.5 overall, or equivalent, with a score of 5.5 in all other components.

## Structure

### Course structure

A research degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

[View Biological Science - Research on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=BS999&year=25)

### Assessment

The aim of undertaking your PhD within our School of Life Sciences is to train you to become an independent researcher who can critically assess research work, and who has a comprehensive understanding of at least one area of biology.

Our PhD programme is usually three to four years' duration. All our students are initially registered as MPhil students, then transfer to the PhD in the first half of their second year of study if they have made satisfactory progress.

### Dissertation

Within our School of Life Sciences, you attend two formal supervisory board meetings each year, where you submit literature reviews and research reports to the Board members. At these meetings, the documents are discussed with you and your progress is assessed.

Your PhD thesis is generally completed within three to four years and has a maximum length of 80,000 words. Great importance is given to the completion of PhDs within a four-year period from the time of initial registration.

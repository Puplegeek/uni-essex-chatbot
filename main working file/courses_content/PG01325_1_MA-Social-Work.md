[Health and Social Care (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care)

Social work is a human rights profession; be part of it.

This course, unique to the UK, provides an opportunity for you to qualify as a social worker while at the same time engaging with debates around the importance of human rights and social justice in the context of social work practice.

Building on the success of our existing Social Work programmes and the global reputation of the University's outstanding human rights research, we've designed a new postgraduate approach to social work education. Our Social Work students will not only acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to practice as social workers, but they will also have the opportunity to learn about the importance of human rights.

We've blended theory and practice throughout to nurture you from a trainee social worker to a confident professional practitioner. You will explore the fundamental principles of human rights and equality, and examine how these doctrines will underpin your practice. You will also cover topics including:

* Service users autonomy* Social justice and values* Equality and diversity* Safeguarding and protection* Evidence-based relational practice

The School of Health and Social Care is proud to work closely with our Service User Reference Group (SURG). SURG is made up of service users, carers, and volunteers who generously share their first-hand experiences of health and social care. We work collaboratively with SURG to design our courses to ensure that we truly are putting the needs of patients and clients at the heart of what we do. SURG are involved as part of our course application processes and often form part of our interview panels. This helps us to be confident that we are selecting the right applicants for the course and their future careers. SURG members also support the delivery of our teaching sessions and research activity, which means you'll benefit from an insight into their lived experiences of living with a diagnosis, health condition, or circumstance. You'll find that not only does your clinical knowledge expand, but your empathy, compassion and ability to advocate develops also. You can find out more about SURG by reading their [blog here](https://www.essex.ac.uk/news/2018/12/20/involvement-matters).

### Placement Opportunities

Within the School of Health and Social Care, we value the experience and opportunity that a placement can give you. It is an intrinsic part of many of our courses. You will do at least 170 days in practice placement during your time with us.

Whilst on placement, your week will be divided between four days on placement and one day dedicated to academic work with significant input relating to critical, reflective and human rights based practice.
Our partnerships with placement providers ensure you gain effective, high-quality training, allowing you to gain experience working with children, adults, families and communities.

When you are on placement, the placement provider is expected to meet the travel costs incurred as a result of work carried as part of that placement (i.e. travel to meetings, etc). However, you will be expected to meet the costs of travel to and from placement.

Social Work students may be eligible to apply for the NHS Social Work bursary, which can be put towards paying for tuition fees, maintenance costs, or travel to placement. More information is available on our [funding pages.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care/scholarships-and-funding#SWB)

**DBS and Occupational Health Checks**

This course requires a satisfactory Occupational Health Check and enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Check (including child and adult barred list check) - both of these are organised by the University. Please contact our [DBS team](mailto:DBS@essex.ac.uk) or  [Occupational Health team](mailto:studentoh@essex.ac.uk) if you have any questions in relation to these checks.

You will also be required to register for the DBS Update Service (information relating to this service can be found  [here](https://www.gov.uk/dbs-update-service)). You will need to register for this within 30 days of your DBS certificate being issues. The Update Service costs £13 per year, which the University will reimburse. You will need to keep the subscription to this Service active for the duration of your course. If you do not register for the Update Service within 30 days, or your registration lapses, and you later attend placement where this is a requirement, you will have to pay for a new DBS check, which will enable you to sign up to the Update Service. Please contact our [DBS team](mailto:DBS@essex.ac.uk) if you have any questions relating to this.

A satisfactory Overseas Criminal Record Check/Local Police Certificate is also required, in addition to a DBS Check, where you have lived outside of the UK in the last 5 years for 6 months or more. Further information about how to obtain an Overseas Criminal Record check can be found on the [Gov.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criminal-records-checks-for-overseas-applicants).

We continue to recommend Covid and flu vaccination to all of our students. This is to protect both yourself and the vulnerable people that you may meet throughout your placement.

**Driving License**

The University doesn't require you to drive for admission to the social work programme, but some Local Authorities may need students to have a driving license and access to a vehicle. An international driving license is valid for one year, after which it must be converted to a UK license. If you can't drive, your choice of placement may be limited, and many employers consider it essential for the role. So, it is advantageous if you can drive or be able to learn to drive during your training.

### Professional accreditation

## Structure

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: CORE

Foundations of Social Work Theory and Practice

(15 CREDITS)

An introductory module exploring the knowledge and understanding that underpins the effective practice of social work. The module examines a variety of social science theories, models, and perspectives used by social workers to understand the lives of the individuals, groups, and communities whose interests they serve. These are organised around the practice themes of strengths-based approaches, relational and solution-focused social work, leadership, and human rights.
There is a specific focus on the development of the profession in response to the evolution of human rights thinking and the complex relationships the vocation entails between social control, advocacy and the promotion of wellbeing.
This module considers social work's rich and contested history and the evolution of its core values. It does this by examining a range of sociological and psychological theories, models, and perspectives of human behaviour and some aspects of human growth and development that are dealt with in more detail in the subsequent module, Life Span and Development. This is intended to furnish students with some of the underpinning knowledge they will need to engage in effective practice. As with other modules in the social work programme there will be specific consideration given to the role of human rights, collective responsibilities, and respect for diversity that have informed the development of social work as a field of enquiry and vocational practice.

[View Foundations of Social Work Theory and Practice on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=HS650&year=25)

COMPONENT 02: CORE

Law, Policy and Ethics

(15 CREDITS)

The central purpose of this module is to provide an environment where students can explore issues and concerns of legislation, policy-making, and ethics in practice. The module will also focus on building the foundations of legislation relating to children and young people, adult social care, mental health, and mental capacity.
Through this module, social work students will have the opportunity to explore the process of ethical decision-making alongside students and tutors from the Law Clinic. Law and social work staff will be making use of the giving voice to values approach which focuses on empowering decision making for transformational leadership.
The module will include an exploration of the notions of social justice, moral judgment, equality, and the impact of legislation and guidance on people and people's rights- in short, social work what one writer has termed social works "rights and wrongs" (Doel, 2016).

[View Law, Policy and Ethics on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=HS651&year=25)

COMPONENT 03: CORE

Life Span Development

(15 CREDITS)

This module explores social, cognitive, and behavioural development across the lifespan through a social work lens. Students will be introduced to established and emerging theories of human development and supported to critically assess their validity and alignment with social work practice, values and ethics. Adopting a human rights framework, students will also be encouraged to critically deconstruct the constructs of 'pathology' and 'normality' within the context of human development.
Social workers engage with individuals and groups at all stages of the life-course. An understanding of key theories and perspectives for understanding the life-course, including structural, psychological and biological factors, and the interplay between these, is essential to effective social work practice. A consideration of the social, historical and economic contexts which shape individual development is also critical for understanding uneven patterns of development through the life-course. The goal of this module is to provide students with the skills needed to understand life course development and its importance to social work practice.

[View Life Span Development on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=HS653&year=25)

COMPONENT 04: CORE

Practice Placement 1

(30 CREDITS)

The module will support students throughout the duration of the first placement including: preparation for placement, development of knowledge and skills relevant to practice, support for reflection, professional and personal challenge, and evaluation of own practice.

[View Practice Placement 1 on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=HS654&year=25)

COMPONENT 05: CORE

Using Research and Evidence in Social Work Practice

(15 CREDITS)

This module explores the research processes used in the collection of an evidence base for social work practice and supports the student to interrogate material and develop their understanding of existing research.
Based on the premise that research and scientific inquiry provide the ground for knowledge production and sustain social work practice, the course introduces students to social science research concepts, tools, and methods and demonstrates their application in social work research, practice, and evaluation. It also builds an understanding and critical appreciation of evidence-based and evidence-informed practice. Students will develop necessary research skills that will allow them to confidently engage with diverse research methodologies and critical issues that can be used to advance practice knowledge, evaluate individual practice, evaluate social programs, as well as to contribute to social work research.

COMPONENT 01: CORE

Critical Issues in Contemporary Social Work

(15 CREDITS)

The module focuses on the centrality of critical analysis that informs effective leadership within social work practice and reflects the increasing awareness of the role of professional challenge in interdisciplinary and partnership working. At the core of this module will be opportunities for the student to bring together some of their learning over the course of the degree and to think about their future development and the future of social work.

[View Critical Issues in Contemporary Social Work on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=HS652&year=25)

Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our [programme specifications](http://www.essex.ac.uk/programmespecs/). The University would inform and engage with you if your course was to be discontinued, and would provide you with options, where appropriate, in line with our Compensation and Refund Policy.*

*The full Procedures, Rules and Regulations of the University governing how it operates are set out in the Charter, Statutes and
Ordinances and in the University Regulations, Policy and Procedures.*

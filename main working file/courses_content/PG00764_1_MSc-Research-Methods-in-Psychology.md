Do you have an undergraduate degree in psychology and want to expand your knowledge of psychological theories and methods?

Our MSc Research Methods in Psychology provides you with advanced training to develop your awareness of psychological science in relation to its philosophical and biological contexts, and to conduct research in the natural and social sciences. In addition to this research-focused training, you also study advanced topics in psychology that will extend your theoretical knowledge. In doing so, you examine some of today's most pressing societal challenges by investigating how people think about, interact with, and experience the world around them.

Explore topics including:

* methods in cognitive neuroscience* advanced statistical techniques* research management* interview analysis

If you intend to pursue a career as a research psychologist or undertake a research degree, our MSc Research Methods in Psychology gives you the advanced research training needed to prepare for a PhD and enhances your chances of obtaining funding. Our [Doctoral Training Partnerships (DTPs)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/doctoral-training-partnerships) offer you skills training and funding for your postgraduate research. We are supported by some of the most prestigious funding bodies, including the European Commission and the Leverhulme Trust.

We are a warm and friendly [Department of Psychology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology), and we wish to welcome recent graduates of psychology or a closely related subject such as cognitive science. This course is popular with international students, particularly those from North America. Our students receive a high-quality Masters degree within one year and benefit from small class sizes and strong research training.

Why we're great.

* Specialise in psychological science using research, statistics, and analysis.
* ESRC Doctoral Training Centres offer a range of studentships for students undertaking research.
* We are 17th in UK for research power in psychology (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021).

### Our expert staff

The Department of Psychology at Essex supports world-leading, interdisciplinary research that promotes a better Understanding of Our Place in the World. This organisation of our research mission allows us to unite and synthesise knowledge across core psychology disciplines and beyond. To contribute to our mission, staff often dismantle conventional, disciplinary boundaries. This unique approach benefits from the use of multi-methodological approaches, while nurturing the translation of our research findings into practical tools that benefit society.

Our [academic staff](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/people/academic) include award-winning teachers and prize-winning researchers who are international experts in their own research areas. We are 17th in the UK for research power in psychology (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021). Our department is also expanding, and has recently appointed a number of excellent researchers whose expertise increases the diversity and depth of our skills base.

* We have a strong expertise of researchers who focus on the psychological underpinnings of individual and group-motivated behaviour and reasoning. Our work in this area brings together researchers applying different methodologies to study how people make decisions, remember, and feel and act, e.g. in the political arena and in health and disease. Staff have strong skills in experimental behavioural, electrophysiological, and neuromodulatory techniques.
* We also actively contribute to our understanding of how we perceive and present ourselves in relation to others, and how this affects our behaviour and well-being. Staff study individual and group processes that are fundamental to social relations and that address questions around social wellness, sexual and interpersonal relationships, and their links to identity and meaning of life, justice, and trust. They also focus on education, language, and cross-cultural processes and their interaction. Theme members use multiple methodologies, including self-report, behavioural observations, and (electro-)physiological measures to provide a wide-ranging look into the psychological processes underlying society's pressing issues and that guide our most important social interactions.
* Many of our staff and research students help to unravel the physiological and neural underpinnings of how we experience and perceive our body states, how we see, and how we control our actions. They further answer questions on how our perceptions and experiences change as we age. Infant and children work is conducted in our Essex Babylab, the leading infant lab in the East of England. Staff use a variety of techniques, including EEG, fNIRS, fMRI, TMS/tDCS, physiological and behavioural measures.

### Specialist facilities

We are committed to giving you access to [state-of-the-art facilities](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/facilities) in higher education, housed entirely within our purpose-built psychology building on our Colchester Campus:

* dedicated laboratories to employ a range of cutting-edge methodologies when carrying out your research projects* specialist areas to study visual and auditory perception, developmental psychology, and social psychology* a virtual reality suite and an observation suite* our Babylab, the leading infant lab in the East of England that explores perceptual, emotional, and cognitive processes in infants* our multimillion-pound Centre for Brain Science (CBS), which allows staff and students to investigate brain activity (including electrophysiology (EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)) and houses a range of facilities to measure eye movements and physiological responses (such as heart rate and skin conductance)* a first-of-its-kind dedicated [Minecraft Lab](https://60stories.essex.ac.uk/minecraft-the-power-of-play/index.html), which uses the popular game to study human behaviour in situations that might be impractical or unethical to recreate in the real world

### Your future

With the skills and knowledge you acquire from studying within our Department of Psychology, you will find yourself in demand from a wide range of employers.

Graduates from this course go on to work in a diverse range of careers and industries. [Recent graduates](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/careers) are working as survey officers, research assistants, and data analysts at organisations such as the Institute for Social and Economics Research, Vita Health group, and the Office of National Statistics.

Others continue their education in counselling and clinical psychology and hold positions such as senior psychological wellbeing practitioner and assistant psychologist at organisations such as the NHS. We also have excellent links with the research community for those interested in careers in research and teaching in a higher-education context. We are recognised by the ESRC as providing excellent postgraduate training, and are an accredited Doctoral Training Centre, offering competitive [studentships](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/doctoral-training-partnerships/senss).

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

There's never been a better time to train as a nurse! Not only is public appreciation for nurses growing, so is the funding. [You can now apply for a £5000 grant that you won't need to pay back!](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/learning-support-fund) There is also an extra £3000 funding available depending on your personal circumstances. You can find more information about eligibility and how to apply on the  [HSC Scholarships and Funding page.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care/scholarships-and-funding)

Nurses are visible in all walks of life - hospitals, patients' homes, doctors' surgeries and care homes. They form the largest group of staff employed in the health and social care sector, and are crucial to everything we do in society today. With 86% of our undergraduate graduates in employment or further study (Graduate Outcomes 2024), we're confident our BSc Nursing (Adult) will help you to build a career that really makes a difference.

Adult nurses work with adults of all ages with diverse health conditions. Communication skills are essential to set patients at ease under pressurised and sometimes difficult situations, as is the ability to assess, plan, implement and evaluate the care offered to each patient. You must be willing to take responsibility for someone else's health and well-being, and show the compassion needed to ensure a good nurse-patient relationship.

Unlike many of the older, traditional nursing schools, at Essex you receive a fresh, contemporary and relevant nursing programme. You work with local organisations to ensure that you gain the best experience possible during your time with us, and studying alongside other health professionals means that you also have the opportunity to gain expert knowledge from them. We provide support throughout all aspects of your journey, including dedicated support in literacy and numeracy.

The School of Health and Social Care is proud to work closely with our Service User Reference Group (SURG). SURG is made up of service users, carers, and volunteers who generously share their first-hand experiences of health and social care. We work collaboratively with SURG to design our courses to ensure that we truly are putting the needs of patients and clients at the heart of what we do. SURG are involved as part of our course application processes and often form part of our interview panels. This helps us to be confident that we are selecting the right applicants for the course and their future careers. SURG members also support the delivery of our teaching sessions and research activity, which means you'll benefit from an insight into their lived experiences of living with a diagnosis, health condition, or circumstance. You'll find that not only does your clinical knowledge expand, but your empathy, compassion and ability to advocate develops also.

There are four main types of pre-registration nursing degree – child, learning disabilities, adult and mental health. At Essex we specialise in adult and mental health nursing courses, as well as offering  [apprenticeships](https://www.essex.ac.uk/apprenticeships/health-and-social-care-apprenticeships) for those already in employment in a healthcare setting and  [CPD courses](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care/cpd) for those who already have professional registration. For a full list of our undergraduate and research nursing courses, take a look at our [subject pages](https://www.essex.ac.uk/subjects/nursing).

The cost of required uniform will be fully covered by the school.

### Placement Opportunities

Half of your studies will be spent working in clinical settings – for example, in a ward, a health centre or in client's homes. You will be working alongside nurses as you practice and perfect your skills.

Placements are based in NHS, private and voluntary settings throughout Essex. You will work shift patterns whilst in placement equivalent to approximately a 37.5 hour week. This includes early shifts, late shifts, night shifts, weekend and bank holiday working.

### Location

You can choose to study this course at either our Colchester campus or
our Southend campus - and your placements will correspond to the campus you choose.
Colchester students will have placements in north Essex, while Southend students
will have placements in south Essex.

Whilst this course is offered at both our Southend and Colchester campuses, we recommend that you consider which location would suit you best and apply for that campus. If you apply to multiple campuses, you will only have one interview and your chances of being offered a place will be the same as if you had only applied to one campus.

If you wish to change campus at any point during the admissions process then please contact your Admissions Adviser who will do their best to accommodate your preference. Changing campus is subject to availability.

### Making your application

Before you make your application, take a look at our frequently asked questions section at the bottom of our [undergraduate department pages](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care/undergraduate). Here you will find hints and tips on what we are looking for, as well as useful resources to help you prepare for interviews.

**DBS and Occupational Health Checks**

This course requires a satisfactory Occupational Health Check and enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Check (including child and adult barred list check) - both of these are organised by the University. Please contact our [DBS team](mailto:DBS@essex.ac.uk) or  [Occupational Health team](mailto:studentoh@essex.ac.uk) if you have any questions in relation to these checks.

A satisfactory Overseas Criminal Record Check/Local Police Certificate is also required, in addition to a DBS Check, where you have lived outside of the UK in the last 5 years for 6 months or more. Further information about how to obtain an Overseas Criminal Record check can be found on the [Gov.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criminal-records-checks-for-overseas-applicants).

**Vaccinations**

We continue to recommend Covid and flu vaccination. This is to protect both yourself and the vulnerable people that you may meet throughout your placement.

### Professional accreditation

Recognised by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) for the purpose of registration as a qualified nurse (adult).

Why we're great.

* 97% of our School of Health and Social Care UG graduates are in employment or further study (Graduate Outcomes 2023).
* Our focus is on producing nurses with empathy as well as technical skill.
* Much of your study is spent in clinical settings, working alongside nurses and other professionals.

### Study abroad

Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.

Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.

If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university

### Our expert staff

A unique feature of our School is that many of our staff work with local NHS Trusts and other local agencies, which enhances our grasp of the contemporary links between academic research, the major issues of the day and practice.

We specialise in applied, multidisciplinary research that addresses issues of national and international concern to health and social care policy and practice and related fields. We also host the [NIHR Research Design Service for the East of England.](https://arc-eoe.nihr.ac.uk/)

### Specialist facilities

The School of Health and Social Care is located at two sites; in the Kimmy Eldridge building at our Colchester campus and in the Gateway Building at our Southend campus.

We have purpose-built nursing skills labs at both our Colchester and Southend campuses to meet the needs of a growing and lively School. View our image gallery and find out more about our [### Your future

### English language requirements

**English language requirements for applicants whose first language is not English:**  IELTS 7.0 overall with a minimum of 6.5 in writing and 7.0 in all other components, or specified score in another equivalent test that we accept.

Details of English language requirements, including component scores, and the tests we accept can be found [here](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/documents/admissions/hscIeltsAndEquivalents.pdf)

If we accept the English component of an international qualification it will be included in the academic levels listed above for the relevant countries.

**English language shelf-life**

Most English language qualifications have a validity period of 5 years. The validity period of Pearson Test of English, TOEFL and CBSE or CISCE English is 2 years.

If you require a Student visa to study in the UK please see our [immigration webpages](https://www.essex.ac.uk/international/immigration-and-visas) for the latest Home Office guidance on English language qualifications.

**Pre-sessional English courses**

If you do not meet our IELTS requirements then you may be able to complete a [pre-sessional English pathway](https://www.essex.ac.uk/international/pre-sessional) that enables you to start your course without retaking IELTS.

**Pending English language qualifications**

You don’t need to achieve the required level before making your application, but it will be one of the conditions of your offer.

If you cannot find the qualification that you have achieved or are pending, then please email [ugquery@essex.ac.uk](mailto:ugquery@essex.ac.uk).

### Additional Notes

If you’re an international student, but do not meet the English language or academic requirements for direct admission to this degree, you could prepare and gain entry through a pathway course. Find out more about opportunities available to you at the [University of Essex International College](https://www.kaplanpathways.com/colleges/university-essex-international-college)

## Structure

### Course structure

Our Nursing programmes consist of three terms per year. This structure adopts a developmental approach to the mastering of nursing skills and development of knowledge and understanding. It has a 50:50 split between theory and practice which means that for 50% of your programme, you undertake clinical practice by working with nurses in a variety of settings (primary and secondary care, public and private sectors, adult and the elderly, acute care and specialist services). Service user-centred care planning emphasises the holistic nature of health and illness. Alongside this experience, you are given the opportunity to rehearse practical skills in a controlled environment further preparing you for working in the practice environment.

As you undertake a significant part of your programme in placement areas we work in partnership with the NHS and the independent health and social care sector across Essex where you will spend your placement hours so that you gain the best clinical learning experiences. Whilst on placement you will have a mentor allocated to you and contact with a member of the academic team linked to that placement. You will work shift patterns whilst in placement equivalent to a 37.5 hour week. This includes early shifts, late shifts, night shifts, weekend and bank holiday working.

Attendance at all parts of this programme is compulsory (as are the modules you study) and must be evidenced in order to register as a nurse.

These carefully selected modules will give you the chance to explore, question, and create powerful ideas. Picked to give you an extensive and in-depth education, they'll equip you with the specialist knowledge, vital transferrable skills, and the confidence to make a genuine difference to the world around you.

We're reactive, we're pioneering, we never stand still, so modules might change from year to year in response to new developments and innovation. Those listed below show how a typical course might look, but more detail on course structure, including details of all optional modules, is available on our [Programme Specification](http://www.essex.ac.uk/programmespecs).

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

### Teaching

Nursing students undertake 50% of the programme on placement in clinical practice and 50% undertaking campus-based study. On a typical week when on campus , nursing students will undertake 37.5 hours of study, this is usually made up of 30 hours of on-campus teaching and 7.5 hours of self-directed study. On placement in clinical practice, nursing students will work a shift pattern equivalent to approximately 37.5 hours per week, including early shifts, late shifts, night shifts, weekend and bank holiday working. Nursing students are required to gain experience of the range of hours that nurses work and will be expected to follow the shift patterns worked in a range of clinical departments.

* Lectures inform you of the most important topics, with classes allowing you to consolidate your learning through discussion* We work closely in partnership with the NHS and the independent health sector to provide placement opportunities* Modules have their own accompanying webpages on Moodle where you can download relevant readings, power-points, podcasts and YouTube clips, and contribute to online discussions

### Offer Holder Days

If you are an undergraduate student residing in the UK who has received an offer to study with us in October 2024, you will receive an email invitation soon to book onto one of our Offer Holder Days. Our Colchester Campus Offer Holder Days run from February to May 2024 on various Wednesdays and Saturdays, and our Southend Campus Offer Holder Days run in April and May 2024 on various Wednesdays and Saturdays. Offer Holder Days provide the opportunity to meet your department, tour our campus and accommodation, and chat to current students. We appreciate that travelling to university events can be expensive, so we are offering an Offer Holder Day Travel Bursary, allowing you to claim up to £150 as reimbursement for travel expenses. For further information about Offer Holder Days, including terms and conditions and eligibility criteria for our Travel Bursary, please visit our [Offer Holder Days](https://www.essex.ac.uk/visit-us/offer-holder-days) webpage. Please note, if you have already claimed a travel bursary to attend your interview in person, then you will not be able to claim a second travel bursary to attend an Offer Holder Day.

If you are an overseas offer-holder, you will be invited to attend one of our virtual events. However, you are more than welcome to join us at one of our in-person Offer Holder Days if you are able to - we will let you know in your invite email how you can do this.

### Interview

Undergraduate students who apply for our health-related courses are required to pass a compulsory interview before an offer can be made. If you are shortlisted for interview based on your application, you will be invited to interview with us via Microsoft Teams or in person on campus - you can choose, subject to availability of our in person dates. We use the interview as an opportunity to get to know you, to find out about your ambitions, and assess how prepared you are for the course. It's important for us to be sure that you know what you're signing up for, so we'd expect you've done some research about the course and the associated careers it may lead to. We have some more information about how to demonstrate you have what it takes at the bottom of our  [undergraduate page](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care/undergraduate#application)

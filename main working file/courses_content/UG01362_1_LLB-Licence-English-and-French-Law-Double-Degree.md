Your first two years on our prestigious LLB Licence English and French Law (Double Degree) course are spent at Essex, where you take the required modules in English Law, meeting the requirements for the academic stages of training to become a solicitor or barrister in the UK. During this time in the UK you also learn French law, which is taught in French.  [Read about Anna Massy's experience](https://www.essex.ac.uk/blog/posts/2022/12/09/french-law-and-common-law-double-degree) of studying in our Double Degree.

After two years at Essex, your third year is spent at one of the following partner institutions in France, where you follow modules in French law to obtain the Licence en Droit:

* [Université Paris-Nanterre](https://ufr-dsp.parisnanterre.fr/)* [Université Lyon III Jean Moulin](http://facdedroit.univ-lyon3.fr/)* [Université Toulouse Capitole](https://www.ut-capitole.fr/)* [Université Côte d'Azur](https://droit.univ-cotedazur.fr/)

Students will pay University of Essex tuition fees for the first and second year of study and will pay tuition fees to their French university for their third year.

Not only will you learn legal rules, but you will also consider the function of law in society, the philosophy of law, policy issues and law reform. For instance, you address the rights of consumers, family members, prisoners, householders, workers and children. You'll also cover topics including, but not limited to:

* The functions of the three branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial)* UK and French constitutional law* Law of trusts* Principles of negligence* Criminal liability

### Why choose a three-year Double Degree?

This three-year degree gives you more flexibility. Following France's Ministry of Education Reform in 2016, our new 3-year programme (LLB and Licence) gives you the flexibility, once completed at end of Licence 3, to select a 2-year integrated Masters course at a University in France or an LL.M. course in the UK (or abroad). The selection at master level takes place at Master 1 (at end the of Licence 3) and no longer at Master 2 (at the end of Master 1).

Under this new system the Master 1 and Master 2 must both be completed at the same University, so if you change from one degree to another at the end of Masters year 1, you will need to start a new Master's degree from the beginning. The LLB English and French Law (Licence) gives you the flexibility in choosing your masters route. We offer the largest Double Degree in the UK.

Please note that you are required to be bilingual in French and English in order to be accepted onto this course.

### Course structure

We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of core/compulsory modules, and optional modules chosen from lists.

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you.

However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Applying

Applications for our full-time undergraduate courses should be made through the [Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.com/). Full details on how to apply can be found on the [filling in your UCAS undergraduate application](https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/applying-university/filling-your-ucas-undergraduate-application) web page.

Our UK students, and some of our EU and international students, who are still at school or college, can apply through their school. Your school will be able to check and then submit your completed application to UCAS. Our other international applicants (EU or worldwide) or independent applicants in the UK can also apply online through UCAS Apply.

The UCAS code for our University of Essex is **ESSEX E70**. The individual campus codes for our Loughton and Southend Campuses are 'L' and 'S' respectively.

You can find further information on how to apply, including information on transferring from another university, applying if you are not currently at a school or college, and applying for readmission on our [How to apply and entry requirements](https://www.essex.ac.uk/undergraduate/applying-to-essex) page.

### Offer Holder Days

If you receive an undergraduate offer to study with us in October 2026 and live in the UK, you will receive an email invitation to book onto one of our Offer Holder Days. Our Colchester Campus Offer Holder Days run in Spring 2026 on various Wednesdays and Saturdays, and our Southend Campus event will also run in Spring 2026. These events provide the opportunity to meet your department, tour our campus and accommodation, and chat to current students. Please visit our [Offer Holder Days webpage](https://www.essex.ac.uk/visit-us/offer-holder-days) for more information, including terms and conditions.

If you are an overseas offer-holder, you are more than welcome to join us at one of our in-person Offer Holder Days if you are able to - we will let you know in your invite email how you can do this. If you can't make it, we will provide plenty of opportunities to get a feel for life at Essex, virtually.

*The University makes every effort to ensure that this information on its programme specification is accurate and up-to-date. Exceptionally it can be necessary to make changes, for example to courses, facilities or fees. Examples of such reasons might include, but are not limited to: strikes, other industrial action, staff illness, severe weather, fire, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack (whether declared or not), natural disaster, restrictions imposed by government or public authorities, epidemic or pandemic disease, failure of public utilities or transport systems or the withdrawal/reduction of funding. Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our [programme specifications](http://www.essex.ac.uk/programmespecs/). The University would inform and engage with you if your course was to be discontinued, and would provide you with options, where appropriate, in line with our Compensation and Refund Policy.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: COMPULSORY

Principles of Translation and Interpreting

(15 CREDITS)

What are your responsibilities when translating or interpreting professionally? What are the contexts in which interpreting can take place? And what tools are available to assist you when translating or interpreting? Examine the issues that face professional translators and interpreters alongside the theoretical concepts and considerations.

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY

Translation Portfolio I

(15 CREDITS)

In this module, students will be engaged in weekly translation of texts belonging to different domains and genres, such as socio-political, medical, and promotional texts, in order to familiarise themselves with the specific requirements of general and specialised translation.
Students will learn to analyse the source texts at various levels, identify translation challenges and overcome them by applying different strategies and translation techniques.
In line with current translation practices, they will be trained in both direct and inverse translation (B?A and A?B). This will ensure that they are equipped to enter the translation market and have an edge over their competitors. They will also be fully prepared to work both at home and in B-language countries.

[View Translation Portfolio I on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=LA815&year=25)

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY

Interpreting Practice I

(15 CREDITS)

This module introduces the fundamental skills and language knowledge of consecutive interpreting (CI) in a selection of languages, namely English-French/German/Portuguese/Spanish/Italian/Arabic and vice versa. The comprehensive training provided aims to equip you with the necessary expertise to work as a professional interpreter, meeting the needs of an increasingly diversified market both locally and globally. The module will develop your abilities to actively and analytically listen, memorize extensive dialogues, interpret, communicate effectively, and transmit messages in both languages.
In this module, you will learn how to implement specific strategies used by interpreters to deal with a range of potential challenges that may come up when interpreting real-life speeches and other types of oral interventions. These could include reusing vocabulary introduced by a speaker, requesting clarification or repetition, and correcting mistakes. In addition, you will be taught how to prepare effectively for interpreting assignments by conducting research, building a range of terminologies, increasing your background knowledge, and utilizing online resources. To enhance your presentation skills such as public speaking, voice projection, pacing, posture, and overcoming speech anxiety, your interpretive performances will be recorded for self-analysis and improvement. It is also expected that you adhere to the professional interpreters' code of conduct by introducing you to principles such as impartiality, neutrality, cultural sensitivity and context-based decision making.

(15 CREDITS)

In this module, students will be engaged in weekly translation of texts belonging to different domains and genres, such as literary, academic, and scientific-technical texts, in order to familiarise themselves with the specific requirements of general and specialised translation.
Students will learn to analyse the source texts at various levels, identify translation challenges and overcome them by applying different strategies and translation techniques.
In line with current translation practices, they will be trained in both direct and inverse translation (B?A and A?B). This will ensure that they are equipped to enter the translation market and have an edge over their competitors. They will also be fully prepared to work both at home and in B-language countries.

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY

Interpreting Practice II

(15 CREDITS)

This module's primary objective is to offer a thorough overview of numerous interpretation methods such as consecutive interpreting (CI), bilateral interpreting (BI), and simultaneous interpreting (SI) tutorial sessions. Utilizing a vast selection of language pairs, including English to French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Arabic and back, students will gain the necessary expertise to satisfy the growing demands of the interpretation market. This module further aids in developing foundational abilities including shadowing, active listening, paraphrasing, public speaking, memorization techniques, and note-taking, ultimately preparing students for diverse professional interpreting roles, whether nationally or globally.
During the advanced stages of this module, students will power up their skills of attentive listening, info memorisation, summarising, interpreting, and cross-language communication. Alongside enhancing interpreter strategies such as seeking clarifications, repetitions, or solving mistakes, students are trained to handle pre-assignment tasks like research, background understanding, terminology construction, and online resource utilization. Throughout the module, professional conduct is emphasized, and real-world scenarios are simulated by hosting CI mock conferences each term. These events not only provide interpreting practice but also opportunities for organization, public speaking, observation, and peer feedback. Furthermore, we organize expert-led workshops and seminars twice a month throughout the academic year, augmenting practical learning and industry insights.

## Overview

The details

Course: 
Advanced Musculoskeletal Assessment and Practice

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Part-time

Duration: 
2 - 6 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences)

This pathway enables experienced clinicians in the musculoskeletal field to advance their practice. All students engage in material related to clinical decision-making, and there are options available to advance clinical skills such as injection therapy and independent prescribing. There is flexibility within this pathway for you to direct your learning to topics and regions of personal interest.

The pathway is aligned with the four pillars of advanced practice (clinical, leadership, education and research) as outlined by Health Education England's framework for Advanced Clinical Practice. To meet the Masters award, workplace supervision is required throughout the programme.

On this course, you gain:

* critical understanding of the key concepts underlying advanced musculoskeletal clinical skills beyond your normal professional scope of practice* opportunity to acquire advanced musculoskeletal clinical skills beyond your normal professional scope of practice* skills to access and critically appraise research findings to develop your own evidence-based practice* enhanced understanding of the essential principles of research design and to conduct an extensive piece of independent research, including: planning, formulating, designing, choosing research methods, collecting data, analysing, interpreting and writing-up* a range of transferable employment-related skills

This course sits within our [School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences). This allows us to bring together our internationally recognised research, share knowledge, and enhance placement and vocational opportunities for our students and graduates.

#### Professional, statutory and regulatory bodies

We are committed to embedding the [NHS Constitution Values](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england) (which are strongly reflected in our University values) into everything we do. They define the behaviours and expectations of all our staff and students underpinning the work we do in the university, clinical arena and other workplaces.

We understand that not all of our students and staff are employed within the NHS. But these values uphold the underlying principles of excellent care as a standard, and as such we expect that anyone who cares for others will aspire to uphold them.

For us, involving not only our students but service users, experts by experience, carers, and NHS/non-NHS professionals in the creation and delivery of all programmes is vital.

### Professional accreditation

Accredited by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP).

Why we're great.

* Study a pathway aligned with the four pillars of advance practice outlined by Health Education England's framework for Advanced Clinical Practice.
* Develop the skills to assess and manage patients with a range of musculoskeletal conditions beyond your normal scope of practice.
* Work with leading experts from a range of fields.

### Our expert staff

We have a range of guest specialists who work with us including Billy Fashanu, consultant physiotherapist, and various other tutors such as consultant rheumatologists, radiologists, consultant neurophysiologists and other injecting practitioners.

### Specialist facilities

This pathway is taught in our School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences at our Colchester Campus. As one of our CPD students, you may be taking modules on campus or online to suit your needs.

### Your future

#### Sport scholarships

Our [Performance Sport Scholarship](https://www.essex.ac.uk/scholarships/sports-scholarships-and-bursaries) programme has been created for talented athletes playing at regional, national or international level, and offers a range of benefits. We want students competing in our focus sports - basketball, volleyball, tennis and football - as well as other team sports and as individual athletes to contribute to our performance sport programme.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

### Applying

If you are intending to follow a modular programme, please email [msk@essex.ac.uk](mailto:msk@essex.ac.uk). You will be guided through how to apply and we will refer you to the relevant programme or module lead to discuss your plans.

From this discussion, a formal outline of the most suitable modules for your professional and personal circumstances will be produced, called a pathway plan. Although your plans may change over time, this formal document helps us plan delivery of modules over the coming years, and it helps your sponsor to plan funding arrangements as appropriate.

### Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)

We recognise the importance of your previous academic learning and professional experience, and you can use both to gain credit value towards the specific programme you are interested in, known as Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).

RPL is dependent on many factors. If you are interested in this option please email us at [cpd@essex.ac.uk](mailto:cpd@essex.ac.uk) before you apply. It is necessary to highlight any prior learning before you apply as the modules you wish to study may be dependent on this. For further information on our RPL procedure, please review the [Postgraduate admissions webpage](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/masters/applying-to-essex).

Please note: there is an administration fee for the RPL process request. More information can be found in our fees document on our [funding page](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care/cpd/funding)

## Overview

The details

Course: 
Conflict Resolution

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Government](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/government)

We're well-established in political science, asking difficult questions to find important answers. How do you put an end to armed conflict? What are the benefits and consequences of intervention? What role do non-governmental organisations play in the prevention and resolution of conflict? Is immigration linked to terrorism? Does climate change affect transnational migration patterns?

Our course helps you understand the evolving field of conflict resolution, exploring the causes and effects of destructive conflict across the world, and scrutinising the theory and practice of how it can be managed peacefully. You don't need a statistical background to study this course – we'll introduce you to research methods and teach you how to use them throughout your studies. Our [MSc Conflict Resolution](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg00508/2/msc-conflict-resolution) is ideal if you have a statistical background and want to learn advanced quantitative skills.

You have access to leading conflict resolution experts in our [Michael Nicholson Centre for Conflict and Cooperation](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/conflict-and-cooperation) and the opportunity to collaborate on research. We also host popular talks with our experts, and with prestigious external speakers, helping you develop a deeper knowledge of conflict resolution.

We provide you with a framework for understanding conflict resolution in inter- and intra-state issues, focusing on topics including:

* Using conflict data sets and drawing geographical maps
* International development and human rights
* International relations and security studies
* Global and comparative politics

Our dynamic, interdisciplinary approach combines traditional methods with contemporary theory and practices of non-violent movements. We encourage you to experience the practical as well as the theoretical application of these topics through examining real case studies of international conflict.

We are 6th in UK for research power in politics and international studies (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021). We're also Top 10 in the UK for politics and international studies in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2024

With this course you also have the opportunity to study abroad at one of our partner institutions and achieve a dual award, which means you'll receive two Masters degrees in two years. Find out more on our [dual award webpage.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/postgraduate/masters/dual-awards)

Why we're great.

* We are 6th in UK for research power in politics and international studies (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021).

* [Professor Ismene Gizelis](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/GIZEL22009/Ismene-Gizelis)
* [Dr Tobias Böhmelt](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/BOHME31205/Tobias-Bohmelt)
* [Dr Zorzete Bakaki](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/BAKAK27506/Zorzeta-Bakaki)

### Specialist facilities

* Access some of the best minds in conflict resolution through our  [Michael Nicholson Centre for Conflict and Cooperation](https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/conflict-and-cooperation). Its scientific approach to the study of conflict emphasises rigorous formal theory and the development of systematic data and statistical methods for evaluating theory* Laboratories of networked computers featuring extensive software for political analysis* Make use of web-assisted learning, simulations, and challenging role-playing exercises* [ESSEXLab](https://www.essex.ac.uk/research/essexlab) provides opportunities for experimental lab research* Student societies for politics, debating, and Model UN* We organise the [Essex Summer School](http://www.essex.ac.uk/summerschool/) in Social Science Data Analysis

### Your future

All Essex politics graduates have the distinction of a qualification from one of the world's leading politics departments.

This course will prepare you for a career in areas such as non-governmental organisations, international and national government, or the private sector.

Recent graduates have gone on to work for the following high-profile organisations:

* The Civil Service* Local government* The World Bank* The United Nations* NATO* YouGov and YouGov America

We also offer [supervision for PhD and MPhil](http://www.essex.ac.uk/government/study/pgr-courses.aspx) in the following fields: government; ideology and discourse analysis; international relations; political behaviour; and politics.

Our academic reputation is illustrated by the fact that many of our graduates now teach or research at universities, colleges of higher education and schools. For example, recent graduates are now research fellows and academic staff at:

* University of Oxford* University College London* Mannheim, Germany* ETH Zurich, Switzerland* Duke University, USA* William Marsh Rice University, USA* University of Amsterdam, Netherlands.

We work with the University's [Careers Services](http://www.essex.ac.uk/careers/) to help you find out about further work experience, internships, placements, and voluntary opportunities.

### One Masters not enough for you?

We offer a number of [postgraduate taught dual awards](http://www.essex.ac.uk/government/study/pgt-courses.aspx) with our international partners. You work for two Masters degrees, one at Essex and another at a prestigious university across the globe, gaining them both in a shorter time than studying them separately. This unique opportunity gives you a competitive edge when applying for jobs or prepares you for PhD study.

> I studied conflict resolution as I experienced the Liberian civil war, and immigrating to Norway as a child, I’ve shaped my view on the world and politics. I know the detrimental effects of war and I wanted to study something that is relatable and important. Our department is one of the best for political research. The research and teaching of academic staff is excellent. They emphasise on skills needed in the workplace and help us be employable. In future, I want to be a diplomat for Norway.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

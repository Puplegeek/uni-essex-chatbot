UCAS code: 
C520

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
3 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Life Sciences (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/biological-sciences)

Our BSc Ecology and Environmental Biology course explores the diversity of the living world, across levels of biological organisation from genes to individuals, their populations and the communities they form, up to entire ecosystems.

Building on research produced in our [School of Life Sciences](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences), you will examine these concepts across terrestrial, marine and freshwater systems, examining taxa from the smallest microbes to the largest organisms on Earth.

You will investigate the crucial role of biodiversity in supporting ecosystem functions and securing the flow of ecosystem services on which humanity depends. The strong theoretical, practical and data-handling skills you develop will help you to understand how biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are changing in response to multiple interacting stressors in the Anthropocene (e.g. climate change, chemical pollution, habitat loss). You will be equipped to design management solutions to tackle current and future challenges to ecosystems and have the option to train in tropical marine biology in Indonesia, as well as environmental biology and ecology on our new Arctic field course.

### Study abroad

Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.

Studying abroadÂ allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.

If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university.

Our students currently study abroad at universities in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, USA, Germany and Sweden.

### Placement year

Alternatively, you can spend your third year on a [placement year](http://www.essex.ac.uk/careers/placements/default.aspx) with an external organisation. This is usually focussed around your course, and enables you to learn about a particular sector, company or job role, apply your academic knowledge in a practical working environment, and receive inspiration for future career pathways.

Organisations our students have recently been placed with include CEFAS, IFCA, ecological consultancies among many others.

If you complete a placement year you'll only pay 20% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course.Â A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules fromÂ which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

COMPONENT 01: COMPULSORY

Research Project in Life Sciences

(45 CREDITS)

This module aims to prepare you for carrying out an individual scientific investigation on a topic relating to your degree. Develop skills to identify a suitable question and then design an experimental approach to obtain data addressing this question. The assessment focuses on your analysis and presentation of these data in a suitable scientific paper format report, on the research, understanding and critical writing about the scientific literature relating to your project. Your oral project presentation skills and response to questions, the planning and management of your project work, your progress reflection and your employability skills will also be evaluated.
This module has been designed to enable students to integrate their subject knowledge with an understanding of sustainable development, acquiring the skills and competencies essential for addressing the urgent sustainability challenges of the 21stÂ century.

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY

Biogeography

(15 CREDITS)

This module provides you with a thorough understanding of biogeography theory, and how this and spatial ecology tools can be applied to issues of environmental and climate change and feed into policy and management solutions for mitigating associated impacts.
We will examine current biogeography and spatial ecology topics. These will include both contemporary and historical drivers of species distributions, the role of climate change in shaping these distributions, and how species traits underpin where they do, don't, can and can't exist. Building on this theory, you will explore management and policy solutions to mitigating environmental and climate change, and how biogeography tools and theory are put into practice.

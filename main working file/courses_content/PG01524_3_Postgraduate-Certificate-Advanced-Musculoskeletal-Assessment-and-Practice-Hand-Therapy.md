## Overview

The details

Course: 
Musculoskeletal Practice (Hand Therapy)

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Part-time

Duration: 
1 year - 5 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences)

We understand that you may not have time for a full-time degree, so our CPD pathways allow you to study flexibly in the way that best suits you. The structure, mode of delivery, and level of support allow you to progress towards a qualification at postgraduate certificate level.

This pathway enables clinicians who have specialised in Hand Therapy to advance their practice. You engage in material related to clinical decision-making, clinical service quality improvement strategies, and advanced clinical skills such as injection therapy. There is flexibility within this pathway for you to direct your learning to topics of personal interest.

On this course, you gain:

* critical understanding of the key concepts underlying advanced musculoskeletal practice
* opportunity to acquire advanced musculoskeletal clinical skills beyond your normal professional scope of practice
* encouragement to contribute to policy-making, planning and evaluation
* a range of transferable employment-related skills

This course sits within our [School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences) This provides an exciting opportunity to join a community specifically focused on sports and exercise science, sports therapy and physiotherapy. This will allow us to bring together our internationally recognised research, share knowledge, and enhance placement and vocational opportunities for our students and graduates.

#### Professional, statutory and regulatory bodies

We are committed to embedding the [NHS Constitution Values](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england) (which are strongly reflected in our University values) into everything we do. They define the behaviours and expectations of all our staff and students underpinning the work we do in the university, clinical arena and other workplaces.

We understand that not all of our students and staff are employed within the NHS. But these values uphold the underlying principles of excellent care as a standard, and as such we expect that anyone who cares for others will aspire to uphold them.

For us, involving not only our students but service users, experts by experience, carers, and NHS/non-NHS professionals in the creation and delivery of all programmes is vital.

### Professional accreditation

Accredited by the British Association of Hand Therapists (BAHT). BAHT has developed an accreditation process of hand therapists’ learning and experience, leading to the award of ‘Accredited Hand Therapist’. Hand therapists may develop their knowledge and skills via BAHT validated courses at HEIs and independent education. Points awarded can be accrued to meet the requirements of the Accredited Hand Therapist award.

Accredited by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP).

Why we're great.

* Study flexibly with a part-time CPD pathway.
* Develop the skills to assess and manage patients with a range of musculoskeletal conditions beyond your normal scope of practice.
* Work with leading experts from a range of fields.

### Our expert staff

We have a range of staff involved with this pathway including [Sarah Golding - Accredited Hand Therapist](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/GOLDI44106/sarah-golding), and various other tutors such as other injecting practitioners and therapists with a special interest in the upper limb.

### Your future

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

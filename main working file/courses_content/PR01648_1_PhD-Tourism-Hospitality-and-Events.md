## Overview

The details

Course: 
Tourism, Hospitality and Events

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
3 - 4 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Edge Hotel School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/edge-hotel-school)

Our research at the Edge Hotel School is interdisciplinary, encompassing tourism, hospitality, and events. Our staff expertise is clustered around three key areas and we welcome PhD students in these or related topics.

Tourism is defined as a social, cultural and economic phenomenon which entails the movement of people to countries or places outside their usual environment for personal or business/professional purposes and as the economic characterisation of tourism that includes spending by visitors on accommodation, food and beverage services, transportation, touring, travel agencies, recreation, entertainment, sports, events, and shopping.

Areas of study may embrace a broad range of sectors and disciplines, including economics, marketing, human resources, management, sociology, psychology, and geography.

Topics may include, but are not limited to:

* Building a more environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable tourism, hospitality, and events sector, that includes sub-sector studies (e.g., nature-based destinations, culturally sustainable tourism, sustainable destinations, cultural heritage tourism)
* Social and cultural issues in tourism, hospitality, and events, including equality, diversity, and inclusion (e.g., dark tourism, cultural encounters and racialised scenarios, food and culinary studies)
* Technology in tourism, hospitality, and events, including artificial intelligence, data, the use of smart technology to improve and innovate visitor experiences and address employment challenges (e.g., deepfakes, innovations in visitor experiences at Wivenhoe House Hotel)

The [Edge Hotel School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/edge-hotel-school) was the first hotel school in the UK to have a fully operational luxury hotel on its campus. This important connection with [Wivenhoe House Hotel,](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/edge-hotel-school/facilities), as well as our extensive partner network with tourism, hospitality and events companies across the UK and internationally makes doing research with us a highly beneficial experience.

Why we're great.

* The opportunity to base your research at our on-campus luxury hotel - Wivenhoe House
* Robust research infrastructure at the Edge Hotel School and the University of Essex
* The chance to work with academics with leading reputations in research in tourism, hospitality, and events

### English language requirements

  

If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 6.5 overall with a minimum component score of 5.5

If you do not meet our IELTS requirements then you may be able to complete a [pre-sessional English
pathway](https://www.essex.ac.uk/international/pre-sessional/) that enables you to start your course without retaking IELTS.

### Additional Notes

The University uses academic selection criteria to determine an applicant’s ability to successfully complete a course at the University of Essex. Where appropriate, we may ask for specific information relating to previous modules studied or work experience.

## Structure

### Course structure

A research degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

### Assessment

You begin your studies by meeting with your supervisors and undertaking an intensive induction programme. You attend advanced research methods training and undertake compulsory modules tailored to your individual research needs.

Throughout your PhD, you have regular meetings with your supervisors. You are often asked to write up your ideas or reading notes to help establish good writing practices. By the end of your first year of research (or second year for the part-time variant), you should have a solid understanding of the key debates in your field and have defined your research questions, outlining your original contribution to knowledge.

Continuing with your studies, you are likely to finalise the design of your own research project and either collect primary data, or access and analyse large scale datasets. You may also make progress on your second research paper. You receive regular feedback on your ideas and findings from your supervisors and are encouraged to develop your own research ideas independently during this year. If you are undertaking fieldwork in another location, your supervisors will still be in touch via email or video call.

You may attend a number of conferences to test out your research findings and thesis on an international stage. Your attendance may be funded by the Edge Hotel School. As well as advising on how to prepare your thesis for examination, your supervisors can advise on future career plans in academia or industry.

### Dissertation

Creating a 60 - 80,000 word thesis is a significant task. To help you finalise your PhD and produce high quality doctoral research, we have a number of support mechanisms.

You undertake a progress board every six months, where you, your supervisors and an independent chair mark your progress and set objectives for the next period. You are also encouraged to take part in peer group debates and discussions.

Our full-time doctorates are 36 month programmes, and 72 months for part-time. At the end of this time, you may be allowed up to 12 months to finish writing up your PhD.

Once you have submitted your thesis, you will be asked to attend a Viva Voce examination with examiners from within and outside of the University. A viva voce examination usually takes place within three months of submission of thesis.

## Fees and funding

### Home/UK fee

£5,006 per year

### International fee

£19,650 per year

Fees will increase for each academic year of study.

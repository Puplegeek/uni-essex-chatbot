The details

Course: 
Gender and Sexuality Studies

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychosocial-and-psychoanalytic-studies)

Our MA in Gender and Sexuality Studies is an innovative, interdisciplinary programme located in the [Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies (PPS)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychosocial-and-psychoanalytic-studies). Our approach is highly interdisciplinary and intersectional, combining elements of sociology, psychology, literature, history, politics, human rights, philosophy, and art. On this course, you will gain a strong grounding in the theories and concepts that have been essential to the study of gender and sexuality while also being supported in the exploration of your own unique cross-disciplinary research interests through our wide range of optional modules from across the University.

In PPS we value the fact that your choice of study is often deeply motivated by your life experience as well future ambitions -- this is perhaps especially the case with Gender and Sexuality studies. Our expertise in psychosocial approaches means that, in studying with us, you will be encouraged to recognise and explore the many ways that issues relating to gender and sexuality bring together personal, social, and political questions (for example, questions of identity and subjectivity, equality and justice, history and global politics). You will learn from scholars whose current research projects demonstrate their own interests and commitments in the field; our specialisms include intersectional feminist theory and methods; LGBTQ+ politics and activism; gendered childhoods; masculinities and youth work; sexuality and health activism; global perspectives on reproductive justice; human rights and refugee communities.

You will also learn from your peers and the wider community. In PPS, we are explicit in our commitment to trans-inclusivity and to ensuring a learning environment in which everyone can flourish. We will offer you a transformative educational experience that will deepen your understanding of gender, sexuality and equality as well as empower you to contribute to future social and cultural challenges.

Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to develop your understanding of key sites of psychosocial life, including:

* Gender* Sexuality* Identity* Race* Class* Family* Work* Psychology* Environment* Normativity* Objectivity* Nation* Capital* Colonialism* Violence* Politics* Health

Why we're great.

* You'll be taught by internationally renowned scholars and teachers, committed to helping you understand how social, historical and psychological factors shape the experience of gender
* You'll be joining a diverse postgraduate community with students from over 29 countries
* You'll learn a range of transferrable skills, theories, and methods that will transform your personal and professional life beyond the university

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: CORE

Research Methods and Dissertation

(60 CREDITS)

What interests you? Do you want to deepen your knowledge, build invaluable research skills and develop your academic freedom? Your dissertation lets you study a topic of your choosing, in depth, with supervision and guidance from our world-leading academics.

[View Research Methods and Dissertation on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA981&year=25)

COMPONENT 02: CORE

Foundations in Gender and Sexuality Studies

(30 CREDITS)

This module seeks to ground students in the interdisciplinary theories that have been essential to feminist theory, queer theory, and the study of gender and sexuality more broadly.
In this respect, the course proceeds both thematically and chronologically, covering some of the 'canonical' feminist and queer interventions and methods, such as rights-based liberal feminism; radical feminism; Black feminism; Marxist feminism; standpoint epistemology; transnational feminism; ecofeminism; intersectionality; AIDS & LGBT activism; queer theory; and trans studies. But, by approaching these texts through contemporary and transportable concepts (like 'borders', 'pandemics', 'mothers,' 'environments', and 'the gaze') we will emphasize the enduring relevance of these foundational texts for making sense of current social experiences and cultural objects.

[View Foundations in Gender and Sexuality Studies on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA991&year=25)

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY

The Psychic Life of Gender

(15 CREDITS)

This module introduces students to some of the ways in which psychoanalytic thought has animated different feminist, trans, and queer accounts of gender since Freud’s time of writing. We will avoid a polarised presentation of psychoanalysis as either friend or foe to progressive accounts of gender, but rather commit to investigating how psychoanalysis – both as theory and as praxis – can productively disrupt our stable knowledge economies, and lend itself to encounters with gender that feature resistance, interruption, revelation, and impasse.

[View The Psychic Life of Gender on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA936&year=25)

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY

Topics in Critical Race and Transnational Feminisms

(15 CREDITS)

This module covers special topics in critical race and transnational feminisms. The module prioritizes an intersectional focus on race, gender, and class, exploring how these three identity coordinates are at work in key sites and locations.
For instance, we consider race and the management of women's bodies; feminist and anti-colonial pedagogies; race, class, and gender in the carceral system; the nature of women's reproductive labor and women's work in a globalized context; and the racial and gendered politics of protest. The module also includes a mid-term field trip to an art exhibition to consider the politics of art and representation.

[View Topics in Critical Race and Transnational Feminisms on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA993&year=25)

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY

Gender, Race, Identity and Human Rights

(15 CREDITS)

Address key challenges for human rights across the developed and developing worlds. So-called identity politicking has emerged in the past 40 years as a prominent and deeply controversial phenomenon within most societies. It is undeniably true that many human rights violations specifically target groups perceived and ascribed identities.
We inhabit societies where intolerance of difference and diversity have become key challenges for the defence of human rights and the pursuit of social justice. The response to this has often involved targeted communities seeking protection from rights-based mechanisms. There exist many instruments within international human rights law that seek to protect and promote distinct communities of people. However, the rights-based approach to identity politicking raises many, difficult to answer, questions concerning the compatibility of rights-based approaches and identity-based politics.

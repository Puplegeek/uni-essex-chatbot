Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
4 - 5 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

[Economics](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/economics)

Our four-year integrated PhD Economics follows the [MRes Economics](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg00542/2/mres-economics) programme for year 1 before beginning the PhD study programme within the department in year 2. Our four-year pathway in the Department of Economics for the PhD economics degree provides you with training to develop the research mind-set for PhD studies and gives you the chance to ask difficult questions, break intellectual boundaries and create new solutions to issues of global concern. You work closely with our creative and committed academics - researchers who are pioneering new solutions to these issues, inspiring your own research.

We are renowned for our [research expertise](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/economics/research) in a number of areas of economics, including the following:

* Behavioural economics* Experimental economics* Industrial organisation, market structure and firm behaviour* Political economy* Social networks* Economic theory* Financial economics and economics of banking* International economics* Macroeconomics and macroeconomic policy* Public finance* Search and matching* Development economics* Family and health economics including gender, population, and migration* Labour economics including inequality and the economics of crime* Microeconometrics* Spatial econometrics and cross-sectional dependence* Semi and nonparametric econometrics* Time series econometrics

We are 4th in UK for research power in economics and econometrics (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021).

You receive training in research methods and tools starting with the modules offered in the MRes Economics programme, followed by advanced research training and expert supervision to reach your full potential, as well as access to top quality research facilities. We also guarantee office space for you from the second year of your PhD studies in our PhD Research Centre, giving you the space and tools to work.

We work with you to teach you how to look at the world through an economist's lens, taking a critical approach to dismantle a proposition, working robust methodologies to build an argument based on rigorous theoretical reasoning and sound empirical evidence.

Our PhD includes advanced economic methods and analysis, with links to research programmes in our [Institute for Social and Economic Research](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/), the [UK Data Archive](http://data-archive.ac.uk/) and other departments at Essex.

Why we're great.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

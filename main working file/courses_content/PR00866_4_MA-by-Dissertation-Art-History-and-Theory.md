For our MAD in Art History and Theory, we offer supervision across a range of fields and
have a long tradition of postgraduate training in all the major areas of European art and
architecture from 1300 to the present, and in the art and architecture of Latin America and
the United States. Essex Art History features a dynamic group of art historians
investigating the production and reception of images and built environments, across cultures
and media from the early modern period to the present. While we adopt a diverse range of
approaches in our writing and teaching, our work demonstrates a commitment to three key ideas:

Please note: part-time research study is also available, and we also offer a PhD and an MPhil in this subject.

Why we're great.

* We have long been recognised for our expertise across a wide range of areas in the history and theory of art, including the Renaissance, nineteenth-century European art, modern and contemporary art, as well as curating and art from Latin America.
* We are 3rd in the UK for research outputs in art history (Grade Point Average, REF2021).
* During the past decade we have been home to several major research projects funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), looking at topics such as photography, surrealism and Latin American art.

### Our expert staff

The support provided by your supervisor is a key feature of your experience as a research student. Your supervisor will guide you through the different stages of your research degree. Initially, your supervisor helps you to develop your research topic and plan; then, you participate in regular one-to-one meetings to comment on drafts, resolve problems and maintain progress on your research.

We are a dynamic group of art historians who investigate the production and reception of images and built environment, across cultures and media, from the late medieval period to the present day.

[Our staff's](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/philosophy-and-art-history/people/academic?type=academic) research interests include activist art, modernist art and totalitarianism, the relationship between art and science, the artistic status of body modification, art and the environment, critical heritage, and the visual culture of social problems. We also have significant experience in curation and public engagement. Recent projects include:

- Paola Di Giuseppantonio Di Franco's UKRI Future Leaders-funded research project, REPLACE- Matt Lodder's *Painted People: Humanity in 21 Tattoos* (HarperCollins, 2022)- Diana Bullen Presciutti's *Saints, Miracles, and Social Problems in Italian Renaissance Art* (Cambridge, 2023)

### Specialist facilities

By studying within our  [School of Philosophical, Historical and Interdisciplinary Studies](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/philosophical-historical-and-interdisciplinary-studies), you will have access to a range
of outstanding facilities to aid your learning and research.

We provide good facilities for postgraduate study, with access to a range of resources and
support mechanisms to foster progression. Our School is home to the Centre for Curatorial Studies,
which brings together research in the field of museology, exhibition studies and curatorial practice,
and also delivers our postgraduate courses in each of these areas.

We are also home to the [Essex Collection of Art from Latin America (ESCALA)](http://www.escala.org.uk).

### Your future

Many of our graduates are now working in academic institutions, in national or regional museums or galleries, or in other arts-related professions, both throughout the UK and abroad. Several graduates are now Professors in leading art history departments such as CUNY, while others have worked as curators at high-profile museums such as the Tate Modern.

### English language requirements

If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 7.0 overall, or equivalent, with a minimum score of 5.5 in all other components.

## Structure

### Course structure

A research degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

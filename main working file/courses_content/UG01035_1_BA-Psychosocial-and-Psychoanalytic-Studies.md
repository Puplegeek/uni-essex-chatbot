[Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychosocial-and-psychoanalytic-studies)

How do we become who we are? Is emotion as strong a driver as reason? What explains our stranger compulsions and desires? Does all behaviour have meaning - even when it appears to be irrational?

Psychoanalysis is an interdisciplinary field of studies and clinical practices, gathering over 100 years of theorization and clinical experience in framing its ideas and concepts about the mind, emotions, social relations, motivation, psychopathology and psychotherapy.

Understanding human experience means looking not only at how we act and relate, but crucially also requires looking inside at what is going on below the surface. In this course you look at the psychological factors that influence our emotions, behaviours and relationships and shape our everyday lives. To understand these factors you will learn psychodynamic concepts, applying them to individuals, relationships and organisations and of course, you will study the pioneering works of Freud, Jung and Lacan.

Here are some of the questions we might cover. Why do we fall in love with certain kinds of people but struggle to relate to others? Why do we get stuck, or lose direction in life? What explains our stranger compulsions and desires? Why are some people prone to psychological illness while others seem to thrive in adversity?

Topics include:

* Psychoanalytic and psychosocial approaches* Child, adolescent and adult development* Trauma and recovery: A psychodynamic approach* Understanding individuals, groups and organisations* Popular Film, Literature and Television: A Psychoanalytic Approach (Freud and Jung)* Freud: Mind, Culture and Society* Where the Wild Things Are: Literature, Childhood, Psychoanalysis* Current debates in depth psychology* Psychoanalysis and the child

Our [Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies](http://www.essex.ac.uk/cps/) is internationally recognised as one of the leading departments for work on the role of the unconscious mind in mental health, as well as in culture and society more generally.

Why we're great.

* We offer you a unique opportunity to study psychoanalytic and psychosocial ideas and their applications with lecturers who are leading researchers and clinicians in their fields.
* Our course has been repeatedly commended for delivering inspiring content and achieving spectacular academic results.
* Our graduates go on to pursue exciting careers in many diverse fields including in the national and international charity sectors, policy and social work, clinical settings, as well as pursuing further academic research.

### Study abroad

Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.

Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.

If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university

### Placement year

This course allows you to spend your third year on a [placement year](http://www.essex.ac.uk/careers/placements/default.aspx) with an external organisation, where you learn about a particular sector, company or job role, apply your academic knowledge in a practical working environment, and receive inspiration for future career pathways. You will be responsible for finding your placement, but with support and guidance provided by both your department and our Employability and Careers Centre.

If you complete a placement year you'll only pay 20% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

COMPONENT 07: CORE

The Psychosocial Imagination

(30 CREDITS)

This introductory, two-term module foregrounds the ‘psychosocial’ in the BA in Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies. Whilst deeply rooted in a range of theoretical ideas, the module will be selective in its treatment of the psychosocial, and illustrative of further areas of study to come at later points in the degree.
The module’s main point of emphasis will be on ‘imagination’, in a dual sense. Both how we might imagine the ‘psychosocial’ as a discipline, with its specific forms of knowledge, theoretical frames and domains of application, but also in the sense that psychosocial studies might give weight to forms of imagination and representation in their capacity to link subjective and embodied existence with social life.

[View The Psychosocial Imagination on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PA134&year=25)

Lacanian psychoanalysis

(15 CREDITS)

This module explores the work of French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. Lacan made links between psychoanalysis and linguistics, anthropology, literature and philosophy.

COMPONENT 07: COMPULSORY

Care, Intimacy, Vulnerability: an Introduction to Psychosocial Theory

(15 CREDITS)

This second-year undergraduate module provides a grounding in theories of the psychosocial with a special focus on care, dependence, intimacy, and vulnerability. It enables you to critically engage with a range of theoretical approaches from psychoanalysis, sociology, critical theory, postcolonial and decolonial theory. Using ‘care, intimacy and vulnerability’ as its main pillars encourages you to reflect on practices of care, being card for and caring for others, as well as how these phenomena intersect with social and clinical processes. The module encourages you to engage with academic debates in a robust way and strengthen your reflexivity by enabling you to explore your own lived experiences of care. It is suitable for you wishing to work with people in various professional roles such as psychotherapy and mental health, social policy and research, human resources, education, and management. The module tallies with the University’s ongoing commitment to tackling the under-representation of ethnic minority groups and follows the principles of a decolonial curriculum by incorporating scholarship from BAME scholars. Finally, in building a solid, decolonial curriculum, the module also promotes greater visibility and inclusion for BAME students.
You may find some of the readings included in this curriculum challenging. Whenever possible readings from non-scholarly sources are included to enable you to engage with ideas written in more accessible ways. The readings will be discussed in the lecture and seminars. You are encouraged to engage with the readings as much as you can manage.
Questions considered include:
1. What is care? What is intimacy? Are care and intimacy central to cultivating strong interpersonal relationships?
2. What circumstances and structures – social, political, and personal – enable the emergence of caring relationships?
3. In what ways and to what extent does care play a crucial role in the organisation of socio-cultural and psychic life?
4. At a time of increasing alienation and loneliness, how can we reclaim meaningful, intimate relationships?

Why do we treat mental health disorders? Is it purely to reduce distress, or is something more complicated going on? Can treatments for mental ill health be interpreted as enforcement or oppression? Alternatively, what happens when therapy is only available to those with socio-economic privilege? Through a critical interrogation of the idea of the ‘cure’, this module poses a question concerning the treatment of mental health disorders and models of recovery.
The module will explore the spaces in which treatment has been situated, ranging from the asylum to the clinic, to the community. Students will be encouraged to think about the political, ethical, and economic implications of different models of ‘cure’ including psychoanalysis and psychiatry. Students will gain an understanding of the history of mental health discourse from the 19th century to the present day, as well as thinking about the current crisis in mental health provision in the UK.

How can the human nervous system control a bionic prosthesis? How can we use engineering to develop treatments for nervous system conditions? Can we tap into and stimulate the brain to augment people's cognitive abilities? Neural Engineering is an emerging area of Biomedical Engineering that uses engineering, maths, biophysics, computer science and psychology to develop treatment for neurological disorders and create innovative interfaces between the brain and computers.

We will equip you with the skills and knowledge to be a leader in the development of novel technologies for the rapidly expanding neural engineering industry, building systems that can change people's lives. You will be taught in a collaboration with the [Department of Psychology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology), which will give you a foundation in the cognitive processes within the human brain.

  
  

Our BEng Neural Engineering with Psychology covers the following areas:

* brain-computer and neural interfaces* analysis and classification of neural signals* brain-activity recording (neuroimaging) and simulation technologies* human experimentation* brain and behaviour* neuroscience* artificial intelligence and machine learning

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

COMPONENT 05: CORE

Digital Electronic Systems

(15 CREDITS)

This module develops the fundamental concepts introduced in the Digital Systems Architecture. We examine how data are represented within digital systems, including floating point, 'text' and 'data' files, and how the conversions between internal and human-readable forms are performed. The design and applications of higher-level logic elements such as counters, registers and multiplexers are discussed, as well as the more general concept of the finite state machine and its design. Transmission of digital data between systems is introduced by examination of the RS232 protocol. Further, fundamental decisions on how such sources should be represented in digital format include sample rates and quantization accuracy are discussed. In the case of audio and video especially, the possibilities for signal processing and data compression are investigated

COMPONENT 06: CORE

Foundations of Electronics I

(15 CREDITS)

This module is one of two concerned with scientific and engineering foundations on which electronics is based. All electronics components are based on physical principles that relate voltage, current flow and the storage or loss of energy. All the theory we need to learn about how circuits behave is based on the fact that electric charge cannot be created or destroyed, and that the energy of each electron just depends on where it is, and how fast it is moving. How charges move in materials depends on their crystal structures. From basic ideas, the main principles of electronics are built up so that they can be used in the wider study of electronics to solve problems.

COMPONENT 04: CORE

Brain-Computer Interfaces and Peripheral-Neural Interfaces

(15 CREDITS)

This module provides an introduction to interfaces between the nervous system and computers as well as some of their applications.
Neural interfaces take two forms:
1. brain computer interfaces (BCIs), which allow direct communication between the brain and a computer and other devices,
2. peripheral neural interfaces (PNIs), which provide a direct communication channel between the nerves that control muscles or that are responsible for sensing (e.g., touch) and other systems.
The types of interfaces covered are non-invasive (they do not require the introduction of any external probes inside the body) and include:
1. BCIs based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, in particular relying on rhythmic brain activity and evoked activity,
2. BCIs based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS),
3. PNIs based on electromyography (EMG, neural signals from the brain to the muscles recorded from muscles).
The types of applications introduced will include, for example, spellers, pointer control, games, VR, prosthetic control, robotic control.
You will be exposed to the basic analysis and classification of neural data required to operate BCIs/PNIs and will gain hands-on experience with building a basic BCI.

Do you enjoy working with people? Want to make a difference in people's lives? If you are keen to become a registered speech and language therapist and want to shape the future of communication, our BSc Speech and Language Therapy pre-registration course can help you achieve your goals. Alternatively, if you are already in full-time employment in a relevant role, and have the support of your employer, you may be interested in our  [Speech and Language Therapy Degree Apprenticeship](https://www.essex.ac.uk/apprenticeships) which also leads to BSc Speech and Language Therapy.

There's never been a better time to train as [you can now apply for a £5000 grant that you won't need to pay back!](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/learning-support-fund) There is also an extra £3000 funding available depending on your personal circumstances. You can find more information about eligibility and how to apply on the  [HSC Scholarships and Funding page.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care/scholarships-and-funding)

Speech and language therapists work with people of all ages who experience communication and swallowing difficulties, enabling them to maximise their independence in their social, academic and working lives. Successful completion of our BSc Speech and Language Therapy programme leads to eligibility to apply for registration with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) as a speech and language therapist.

This is a client-focused course which uses varied learning methods to integrate theory and clinical practice. You undertake day visits and blocks of practice education with speech and language therapists in the workplace. This practical experience helps prepare you for your future as a qualified therapist.

Our course is continuously developed to reflect contemporary health, education and social care practice. Clients, voluntary groups, other allied health professionals, speech and language therapy clinicians and service managers continue to be involved, in order to ensure that changes in speech and language therapy practice are incorporated, keeping your course up to date.

The School of Health and Social Care is proud to work closely with our Service User Reference Group (SURG). SURG is made up of service users, carers, and volunteers who generously share their first-hand experiences of health and social care. We work collaboratively with SURG to design our courses to ensure that we truly are putting the needs of patients and clients at the heart of what we do. SURG are involved as part of our course application processes and often form part of our interview panels. This helps us to be confident that we are selecting the right applicants for the course and their future careers. SURG members also support the delivery of our teaching sessions and research activity, which means you'll benefit from an insight into their lived experiences of living with a diagnosis, health condition, or circumstance. You'll find that not only does your clinical knowledge expand, but your empathy, compassion and ability to advocate develops also.

You share some learning experiences with other healthcare students on similar undergraduate courses. The learning includes inter-professional collaboration, especially during placements. Working alongside other health professionals means that you also have the opportunity to gain expert knowledge from them.

The cost of required uniform will be fully covered by the school.

### Pre-registration Eating, Drinking and Swallowing (EDS) Competencies

The RCSLT have developed [pre-registration EDS competencies (2021)](https://www.rcslt.org/learning/pre-registration-eds-competencies/) in partnership with clinicians and higher education institutions to ensure that all pre-registration SLT students have the same level of competency across the UK. These competencies will become mandatory for all pre-registration SLT students who graduate from 2026 onwards.

The RCSLT pre-registration EDS competencies are embedded into our teaching and placement curriculum. Across your academic programme you will have an opportunity to achieve EDS knowledge and practical competencies. This will be supported through a combination of theory-based lectures, practical workshops, e-learning and clinical placements. EDS observations, supervised EDS assessment and management discussions can occur in a variety of placement locations including, hospitals, community services including visiting people in their own home, care homes, pre-school, schools, special education needs provision, mental health settings, secure settings, adult learning disability settings.

Once you have these pre-registration EDS competencies, you will have an enhanced skills set. Common activities a student and EDS trained speech and language therapist would complete, may include, but is not limited to:

* assessing oral movements* carrying out oral care* completing infection control procedures including hand washing and decontaminating equipment* holding babies* helping to position clients* assisting and/or feeding clients* touching the client's face and neck during assessment to determine movements* travelling to client's homes* being part of difficult discussions with clients and carers* talking to the client and carers about the results of an assessment and future management

You will also find that, should you choose to work abroad once qualified, you will be able to evidence EDS training. This will make it easier to work as a qualified Speech and Language Therapist in countries where the RCSLT have a Mutual Recognition Agreement.

### Placement information

Placements are an integral part of this course and are sourced for you from across a variety of settings (e.g.NHS organisations, independent/private SLT services, charities, and Schools) and client groups (e.g. paediatrics, adults, etc). Your placements will vary in length and are linked to the objectives of the modules you are studying. You will have a minimum of 150 clinical experience sessions (approximately 75 days). Placements will have different structures which include face-to-face, virtual, via telehealth. If you have significant experience in a particular field, we may not return you to that setting so you have the opportunity to advance your skillset.

Speech and Language Therapy placements tend to fall Monday-Friday and within office hours (e.g between 8am -6pm). To provide the best opportunities, we use a wide network of placements across the Eastern region, which means you will likely have to travel approximately 90 minutes from campus. We allocate students on placements throughout the entire East of England region (e.g. Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk, Suffolk) and surrounding areas. Subject to eligibility, you may be able to claim the [NHS Learning Support Fund](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-learning-support-fund) which provides reimbursement of excess travel (i.e. above your regular commute to campus, and inclusive of costs such as hire cars, etc) or accommodation costs incurred due to undertaking practical training on clinical placement.
When you start your course, the SLT Placements Team will collect information about your previous work experience, whether you can drive, and other circumstances in order to aid placing you.

### DBS and Occupational Health Checks

This course requires a satisfactory Occupational Health Check and enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Check (including child and adult barred list check) - both of these are organised by the University. Please contact our DBS team at [DBS@essex.ac.uk](mailto:DBS@essex.ac.uk), or our Occupational Health team at [studentoh@essex.ac.uk](mailto:studentoh@essex.ac.uk) if you have any questions in relation to these checks.

You will also be required to register for the [DBS Update Service](https://www.gov.uk/dbs-update-service). You will need to register for this within 30 days of your DBS certificate being issues. The Update Service costs £13 per year, which the University will reimburse. You will need to keep the subscription to this Service active for the duration of your course. If you do not register for the Update Service within 30 days, or your registration lapses, and you later attend placement where this is a requirement, you will have to pay for a new DBS check, which will enable you to sign up to the Update Service. Please contact our DBS team at [DBS@essex.ac.uk](mailto:DBS@essex.ac.uk) if you have any questions relating to this.

A satisfactory Overseas Criminal Record Check/Local Police Certificate is also required, in addition to a DBS Check, where you have lived outside of the UK in the last 5 years for 6 months or more. Further information about how to obtain an Overseas Criminal Record check can be found on the [Gov.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criminal-records-checks-for-overseas-applicants).

We continue to recommend Covid and flu vaccination to all of our students. This is to protect both yourself and the vulnerable people that you may meet throughout your placement.

### Professional accreditation

Approved by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) for the purpose of providing eligibility to apply for registration with the HCPC as a speech and language therapist.

Recognised by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT) for the purpose of applying for newly qualified practitioner membership.

Why we're great.

* Grounded in social model approach to disability
* Consistently links theory to practice
* Opportunity to extend learning through year abroad or placement year

### Study abroad

Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. This four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.

Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.

If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university

### Placement year

Alternatively, this four year version of our degree allows you to spend your third year with an external organisation. This is an opportunity to further develop professional skills in the workplace by working in a field associated with Speech and Language Therapy practice, for example as a Teaching Assistant, a Speech and Language Therapy Assistant, a Care Assistant, etc.

Your HCPC and RCSLT pre-registration placement hour requirements are met within the standard three years of the BSc Speech and Language Therapy programme.

If you complete a placement year you'll only pay 20% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year.

### Specialist facilities

The School of Health and Social Care is located at two sites; in the Kimmy Eldridge building at our Colchester campus and in the Gateway Building at our Southend campus. This course is based at our Colchester Campus only.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

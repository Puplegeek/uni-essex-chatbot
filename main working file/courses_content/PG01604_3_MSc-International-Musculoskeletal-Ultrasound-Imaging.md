Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Part-time

Duration: 
2 - 6 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences)

We understand that you may not have time for a full-time degree, so our CPD pathways allow you to study flexibly in the way that best suits you. The structure, mode of delivery, and level of support allow you to progress towards a qualification at postgraduate certificate, postgraduate diploma, or Masters level.

This pathway supports permitted clinicians from a range of professional backgrounds to access musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging within their own jurisdiction. You engage with the technical considerations that underpin this imaging modality prior to musculoskeletal scanning protocols. Face-to-face teaching takes place over a four-day block at our Colchester Campus. You will require a [mentor](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences/cpd/ultrasound-mentorship) to complete the clinical learning components of the MSc. The pathway includes optional modules covering ultrasound-guided injections or service evaluation.

On this course, you gain:

* critical understanding of the key concepts underlying musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging* opportunity to acquire practical musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging skills* a range of transferable employment-related skills* ability to evaluate and respond to professional considerations related to musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging* skills to access, and critically appraise, research findings to develop your own evidence-based practice* enhanced understanding of the essential principles of research design and to conduct an extensive piece of independent research, including: planning, formulating, designing, choosing research methods, collecting data, analysing, interpreting and writing-up

This course sits within our [School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences). This provides an exciting opportunity to join a community specifically focused on sports and exercise science, sports therapy and physiotherapy. This will allow us to bring together our internationally recognised research, share knowledge, and enhance placement and vocational opportunities for our students and graduates.

Why we're great.

* Study flexibly with a part-time CPD pathway.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

This is a degree in world-making. You craft stories, characters and plot in order to build imaginary worlds that a player can journey through. Our work is driven by creativity and imagination as well as technical excellence; at Essex you master both game design and computer programming, giving you total control over the worlds you want to create.

Our course gives you the skills to design and specify complex, non-trivial games through focusing on the following areas:

* the mechanics of a game, including gameplay elements and the relationship with story* the concepts and techniques of computer game programming* real and virtual worlds* artificial intelligence behaviours for non-player characters* 2D and 3D graphic effects and game objects (e.g. weapon systems)

At the end of your course, you will be able to create the outline design specification for a computer game of your own design and implement a game using industry-standard techniques.

Our [School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering) is a community of scholars leading the way in technological research and development. Today's computer scientists are creative people who are focused and committed, yet restless and experimental. We are home to many of the world's top scientists, and our work is driven by creativity and imagination as well as technical excellence.

Both for entertainment and for more serious purposes such as virtual reality training, computer games, gamification and games intelligences are increasingly important in today's world.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

Computer Game Design

(15 CREDITS)

Most players think that designing computer games must be easy. How hard can it be? Well, writing books and painting pictures is also “easy”, but would you want to read those books, hang those pictures on the wall – or play those games? This module can’t teach you how to design games, any more than a creative writing module can teach you to write novels or an oil painting module can teach you to paint portraits. What it can do is help people who want – who need – to design games to hit the ground running. Where you run after that is up to you!

Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games are the largest and most sophisticated computer games in existence. This extraordinary module – which is quite unlike any other in the School – covers their design, history, influence and artistry, and is delivered by one of the two individuals who co-invented the genre here at Essex University in the late 1970s. If you’re interested in game design in general and MMO design in particular, you’re not going to find a module quite like this anywhere else.

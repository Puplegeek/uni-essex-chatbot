## Overview

The details

Course: 
Tropical Marine Biology

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
4 - 5 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Life Sciences (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/biological-sciences)

Tropical ecosystems provide important resources locally and globally, and coral reefs are the most diverse of marine ecosystems threatened by human activities.

An Integrated PhD provides a route into research study if you do not have a Masters degree, or have very little research training. It enables you to spend your first year completing a full-time Masters-level qualification, followed by a full-time PhD studied over three to four years or a part-time PhD studied over six to seven years. We also offer a [‘standard' PhD](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pr00941/1/phd-marine-biology) in this subject which can be studied either full-time (three to four years) or part-time (six to seven years).

The first year on our Integrated PhD Tropical Marine Biology, is designed to deliver advanced tropical marine biology theory and to facilitate the development of a comprehensive range of practical and professional skills required by today's employers. As a student of our [School of Life Sciences](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences), you benefit from the breadth of research carried out by our internationally recognised academics, and engage with current research activities both in the UK and abroad. You also have the opportunity to put theory into practice and study coral reef conservation first-hand during the School's annual field trip to the Wakatobi Marine National Park, Indonesia. (Students who join this optional expedition are subject to additional travel costs – the fee for field trips vary from year to year).

In your second year, you move into the PhD element of the course. Research in our School covers a wide spectrum of biology from genes to ecosystems, and this broad-based structure provides opportunities for developing novel ideas and interdisciplinary projects. We offer supervision in all areas of staff expertise in marine biology, including:

* community ecology of coral reef systems* tropical seagrass beds* mangroves and fisheries* deep sea/marine connectivity* ocean acidification* macronutrient cycling

We’re ranked 54th (14th in the UK) for promoting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal for climate action (Times Higher Education Impact Rankings 2024).

Why we're great.

* Our Coral Reef Research Unit is the most extensive of its kind in the UK.
* Become part of our collaborative Research Groups that work on important international and national problems using cutting-edge techniques.
* We have strong links with a range of organisations, such as the Environment Agency, Cefas, Defra, Operation Wallacea, Plymouth Marine Laboratory, Association of Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities.

### Our expert staff

As one of the largest schools at our University, we offer a lively, friendly and supportive environment with research-led study and high-quality teaching. You benefit from our [academics'](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences/people) wide range of expertise on important national and international problems using cutting-edge techniques.

Key academic staff for this course are members of our [Ecology and Environmental Microbiology Research Group](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences/research/ecology-and-environmental-microbiology-group). We have experts in:

* community ecology of coral reefs* tropical marine biology and conservation* coral stress physiology* aquatic community ecology* ecological and evolutionary responses to global change

The University of Essex has a [Women's Network](https://www.essex.ac.uk/student/forums-and-networks/essex-womens-network) to support female staff and students, and our School was awarded the [Athena Swan Silver Award](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences/equality-and-inclusion) in October 2020, which reflects the work carried out by staff in our School to continue to improve equality, including a mentorship scheme, support for postdoctoral research staff, and financial help towards childcare costs for academics who wish to attend conferences.

After your first year, when you start your PhD, you will be allocated a supervisor who will guide you through the different stages of your research degree. In some cases, you may have joint supervision by two members of our staff. The support provided by your supervisor is a key feature of your research student experience, and you will have regular one-to-one meetings to discuss progress on your research. Initially, your supervisor will help you develop your research topic and plan. Twice a year, you will have a supervisory board meeting, which provides a more formal opportunity to discuss your progress and agree your plans for the next six months.

Your technical and intellectual development will be enhanced by becoming part of a [research group](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences/research) and participating in School Seminars.

### Specialist facilities

We have excellent facilities for studying tropical marine biology, both in the laboratory and in the field. [In-house facilities](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences/facilities) include:

* a range of aquatic and terrestrial mesocosms, including large temperature-controlled aquaria for simulating tropical marine systems* replicated environmental outdoor mesocosms simulating tidal and terrestrial systems* a state-of-the-art tropical coral-reef research facility devoted to fully climate-controllable experiments* multiple pH-stating systems to control CO2 concentration for ocean acidification experiments* a suite of field equipment* microbial culturing facilities* advanced bioimaging suite to visualise and analyse images of biological processes in real time

You can access a wealth of local and overseas field sites through ongoing funded projects and collaborations. Extensive marine and estuarine habitats of national and international ecological importance are located within a short distance of our Colchester Campus.

A dedicated study room allows all our postgraduate research students to have access to a desk and a computer outside of the research laboratories. This provides a focal point for our postgraduates, facilitating reading and writing as well as good communication and a sense of community.

### Your future

As the world's environmental problems increase, the demand for qualified marine biologists continues to grow, and postgraduate study is often a requirement for becoming a researcher, scientist, academic journal editor, and to work in some public bodies or private companies.

Our graduates go on to a range of [careers](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/life-sciences/careers). Some continue into a research career by taking up doctoral positions in the UK and overseas. Others work with governmental and non-governmental organisations, environmental agencies, consultancies, and voluntary organisations. We support your career development via a mentoring scheme and employability events.

We additionally work with our [Employability and Careers Centre](http://www.essex.ac.uk/careers) to help you find out about further work experience, internships, placements, and voluntary opportunities.

## Structure

### Course structure

Most of our taught courses combine compulsory and optional modules, giving you freedom to pursue your own interests. All of the modules listed below provide an example of what is on offer from the current academic year. Our Programme Specification provides further details of the course structure for the current academic year.

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.

The research element of your degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

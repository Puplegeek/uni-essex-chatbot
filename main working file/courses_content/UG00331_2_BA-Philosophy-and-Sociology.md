## Overview

The details

Course: 
Philosophy and Sociology (Including Foundation Year)

UCAS code: 
LV83

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
4 years

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Essex Pathways](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-pathways)

On our four-year BA Philosophy and Sociology (including foundation year), we work with you to develop your subject-specific knowledge, and to improve your academic skills. You receive a thorough grounding in these areas during your foundation year (known as Year Zero) to prepare you for a further three years of undergraduate study at Essex. Our five-year version of this course enables you to study abroad during your fourth year of study.

This course has been temporarily suspended 2025-2026.

This course includes a foundation year (Year Zero), followed by a further three or four years of study, depending on whether you choose to study abroad for a year. During your Year Zero, you study three academic subjects relevant to your chosen course as well as a compulsory academic skills module, with additional English language for non-English speakers.

You are an Essex student from day one, a member of our global community based at the most internationally diverse campus university in the UK.

After successful completion of Year Zero in our Essex Pathways Department, you progress to complete your course with our School of Philosophical, Historical and Interdisciplinary Studies.

Philosophy analyses broad ideas around human life and the nature of existence. It concerns theories of reality, knowledge, morality, ethics, rights, legality and aesthetics. Sociology examines the different kinds of social tensions, interactions and networks that make up everyday life. It asks why individuals, groups, cultures and peoples are the way they are and how they might be different.

You will have the opportunity to study both disciplines and work with two of the UK's leading departments – our School of Philosophical, Historical and Interdisciplinary Studies, and our Department of Sociology and Criminology.

You study topics such as:

* Ethics* Philosophy of religion* Culture, identity and subjectivity* Public policy regarding health, the environment, crime and aging* Citizenship, multiculturalism and human rights

Why we're great.

* We equip you with the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed at Essex and beyond.
* Guarantee a place on your chosen course upon successful completion of your foundation year.
* Small class sizes allow you to work closely with your teachers and classmates.

### Study abroad

Your education extends beyond our University campus. We support you extending your education through providing the option of an additional year. The five-year version of our degree allows you to spend the fourth year studying abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the four-year course.

[Studying abroad](http://www.essex.ac.uk/essexabroad) allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised. We have exchange partners in the following areas:

* The United States* Europe* Canada* Australia* New Zealand* Latin America* The Middle East* Hong Kong* Japan

If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university

### Our expert staff

We have some of the best teachers across the University in our [Essex Pathways Department](http://www.essex.ac.uk/pathways/study/ugp/default.aspx), all of whom have strong subject backgrounds and are highly skilled in their areas.

Our [sociology academics](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sociology/people/academic) have their fingers on the pulse of modern society; whether it's the battle between Apple and Spotify or the exploitation of female bodybuilders, we embed our innovative and sometimes controversial research into your course.

As well as publishing bestselling books, our academics have appeared in radio and television broadcasts such as Professor Mike Roper on the BBC World Service broadcast, *London: The Psychology of War* and Professor Pam Cox in the BBC TWO series *Shopgirls: The True Story of Life Behind the Counter* and *Servants: The True Story of Life Below Stairs*.

### Specialist facilities

By studying within our Essex Pathways Department for your foundation year, you will have access to all of the facilities that the University of Essex has to offer, as well as those provided by our department to support you:

* We provide computer labs for internet research; classrooms with access to PowerPoint facilities for student presentations; AV facilities for teaching and access to web-based learning materials.* Our Student Services Hub will support you and provide information for all your needs as a student* Our social space is stocked with hot magazines and newspapers, and provides an informal setting to meet with your lecturers, tutors and friends.

Take advantage of our other extensive learning resources to assist you in your studies:

* An exciting programme of [research seminars](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/philosophical-historical-and-interdisciplinary-studies/news-and-events), reading groups and mini-courses that help you expand your philosophical knowledge beyond what you learn on your course* A comprehensive student support system which will direct you to the best source of advice and support in the case of personal or academic difficulties* Access a variety of philosophy and sociology textbooks and journals in the [Albert Sloman Library](http://libwww.essex.ac.uk)* Links with the [Institute of Social and Economic Research](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/), which conducts large-scale survey projects and has its own library, and the [UK Data Archive](http://www.essex.ac.uk/depts/ukda.aspx), which stores national research data like the British Crime Survey* Our students' [Sociology Society](https://www.essexstudent.com/organisation/7170), a forum for the exchange of ideas, arranging talks by visiting speakers, introducing you to various career pathways, and organising debates

### Your future

Many employers want graduates with critical thinking skills who can think logically and creatively about practical problems.

Many of students are in demand from a wide range of employers in a host of occupations, including law, PR, project management, journalism and the media, teaching, librarianship, the Civil Service, banking, the police and fashion design.

Our recent graduates have gone on to work for a wide range of high-profile companies.

Philosophy develops your transferable skills, providing you with:

* The ability to understand all sides of a dispute objectively and without forming a premature opinion* The ability to work in a team, taking a collaborative approach to problems* The ability to interpret dense text and to communicate effectively* Analytical and problem-solving skills

We also work with the university's  [Student Development Team](http://www.essex.ac.uk/careers) to help you find out about further work experience, internships, placements, and voluntary opportunities.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: COMPULSORY

Introduction to Philosophy

(30 CREDITS)

Begin your study of philosophy with an exploration of epistemology (the theory of knowledge) and identity theory. What does it mean to say that we ‘know’ something? What if that something is ourselves? How do our modes of practical interaction with the world and each other shape our ability to know different kinds of objects? Are there vices of the mind that distort our reasoning and lead our practical deliberations astray? How important is trust in a functional knowledge community? What kind of creatures must we be in order to be capable of knowing things? What role does self-responsibility play in effective knowing? What is it to be a self? How does that differ from having an identity or identities? To what extent are our identities determined by others? Are they up to us? How can the study of philosophy help us with these questions?

[View Introduction to Philosophy on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PY111&year=25)

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY

The Sociological Imagination

(30 CREDITS)

How can sociology help you understand the world in which you live? What are some of the major features and trends in present-day societies? Using sociological tools, you analyse key features of different societies, such as stratification, poverty, racism, consumption, multinational corporations, religion, and the gender division of labour in low-income countries.
This module has been designed to enable students to integrate their subject knowledge with an understanding of sustainable development, acquiring the skills and competencies essential for addressing the urgent sustainability challenges of the 21st century.

Our UK students, and some of our EU students, who are still at school or college, can apply through their school. Your school will be able to check and then submit your completed application to UCAS. Independent applicants in the UK or EU can also apply online through UCAS Apply.

The UCAS code for our University of Essex is **ESSEX E70**. The individual campus codes for our Loughton and Southend Campuses are 'L' and 'S' respectively.

You can find further information on how to apply, including information on transferring from another university, applying if you are not currently at a school or college, and applying for readmission on our [How to apply and entry requirements](https://www.essex.ac.uk/undergraduate/applying-to-essex) page.

### Offer Holder Days

If you receive an undergraduate offer to study with us in October 2026 and live in the UK, you will receive an email invitation to book onto one of our Offer Holder Days. Our Colchester Campus Offer Holder Days run in Spring 2026 on various Wednesdays and Saturdays, and our Southend Campus event will also run in Spring 2026. These events provide the opportunity to meet your department, tour our campus and accommodation, and chat to current students. Please visit our [Offer Holder Days webpage](https://www.essex.ac.uk/visit-us/offer-holder-days) for more information, including terms and conditions.

If you are an overseas offer-holder, you are more than welcome to join us at one of our in-person Offer Holder Days if you are able to - we will let you know in your invite email how you can do this. If you can't make it, we will provide plenty of opportunities to get a feel for life at Essex, virtually.

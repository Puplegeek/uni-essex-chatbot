## Overview

The details

Course: 
Audiovisual and Literary Translation

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Language and Linguistics](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/language-and-linguistics)

Should translated literature be entirely faithful to the original text, or should the translation be free and creative not to lose the poetic elements of the text? How can translation account for wordplay, complex metaphors, untranslatable idioms, and unique literary styles? How to translate experimental literature that ignores grammatical rules or defies stylistic conventions? How to effectively convey social and cultural contexts when translating literary, audiovisual, and multimodal texts? How to make the most of the creative challenges and possibilities associated with subtitling, dubbing, and voiceover?

Building on the internationally recognised expertise of both our [Departments of Language and Linguistics](http://www.essex.ac.uk/langling), and our [Department of Literature, Film and Theatre Studies](http://www.essex.ac.uk/lifts/), our MA Audiovisual and Literary Translation course will allow you to further specialise in literature and literary translation, audiovisual translation, and general translation. We combine translation theory with practice, allowing you to develop an in-depth understanding of the linguistic, stylistic, and cultural aspects of translation. You will develop your own personal translation skills, allowing you to translate a literary work accurately and creatively from one language to another.

Our course is offered with the combination of English and one of the following languages: French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. You can be a native or near-native speaker of any of these languages. You will work with native speakers in developing your ability to move accurately and quickly between your chosen language and English.

Explore our hands-on, practical modules in the Department of Language and Linguistics, covering areas including:

* Audiovisual translation
* Translation portfolio
* Subtitling principles and practice

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course.Â A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules fromÂ which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

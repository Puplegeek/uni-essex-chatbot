## Overview

The details

Course: 
Actuarial Science

Start date: 
October 2025

Study mode: 
Full-time

Duration: 
1 year

Location: 
Colchester Campus

Based in: 
[Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science)

Actuaries provide assessments of financial security systems, with a focus on their complexity, their mathematics, and their mechanisms. Actuaries quantify the probability and manage the risk of future events in areas such as insurance, healthcare, pensions, investment and banking, as well as in non-financial areas. This course is taught by the [School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science) and is intended for those with a first degree in mathematics, statistics, economics or finance looking to acquire knowledge in actuarial science.

Our MSc Actuarial Science course is based on the syllabus of the majority of the core subjects of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, so you cover the following subjects as part of your course:

* CB1 (Business Finance), depending on the optional module selected* CM2 (Financial Engineering and Loss Reserving)* CS2 (Risk Modelling and Survival Analysis)

This focus on up-to-date research findings in actuarial methodologies and actuarial applications means that you gain solid training in actuarial modelling and actuarial analysis.

You can also specialise on a topic of choice, such as:

* actuarial and financial modelling* general insurance* life insurance

You also have the chance to study a problem in-depth through a Masters thesis project on a subject chosen by you or your supervisor.

As part of our School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science, you are a member of an inclusive and approachable research community with an international reputation in many areas, including semi-group theory, optimisation, probability, applied statistics, bioinformatics, and mathematical biology.

We are genuinely innovative and student-focused. Our research groups are working on a broad range of collaborative areas tackling real-world issues.

* Our data scientists carefully consider how not to lie, and how not to get lied to with data. Interpreting data correctly is especially important because much of our data science research is applied directly or indirectly to social policies, including health, care and education.* We do practical research with financial data (for example, assessing the risk of collapse of the UK's banking system) as well as theoretical research in financial instruments such as insurance policies or asset portfolios.* We also research how physical processes develop in time and space. Applications of this range from modelling epilepsy to modelling electronic cables.* Our optimisation experts work out how to do the same job with less resource, or how to do more with the same resource.* Our pure maths group are currently working on two new funded projects entitled ‘Machine learning for recognising tangled 3D objects' and ‘Searching for gems in the landscape of cyclically presented groups'.* We also do research into mathematical education and use exciting technologies such as electroencephalography or eye tracking to measure exactly what a learner is feeling. Our research aims to encourage the implementation of ‘the four Cs' of modern education, which are critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity.

Why we're great.

* Study the majority of the Core Technical subjects of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
* Work alongside expert academics and practicing actuaries.
* Through our pioneering teaching approach we develop the actuarial scientists of the future.

### Our expert staff

Many of [our academics](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science/people/academic) have won national or regional awards for lecturing, and many of them are qualified and accredited teachers – something which is very rare at a university.

Our course teachers are expert academics conducting internationally excellent multidisciplinary research, with significant multi-year experience in consulting and practising actuarial science. Our key actuarial science staff are:

* [Professor Spyridon Vrontos](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/VRONT59308): actuarial and financial data science, predictive modelling, and predictability* [Dr Junlei Hu](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/HUJUN79707): reinsurance and optimal risk transfer* [Dr Peng Liu](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/LIUPE51704): applied probability and queueing systems* [Dr Jackie Wong](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/WONGS11905): Bayesian methods and survival analysis* [Dr John O'Hara](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/OHARA61509): financial mathematics and machine learning in finance

### Specialist facilities

* Unique to Essex is our renowned [Maths Support Centre](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/students/study-resources/tdc/maths/default.aspx), which offers help to students, staff, and local businesses on a range of mathematical problems. Throughout term-time, we can chat through mathematical problems either on a one-to-one or small group basis.
* We have our own computer labs for the exclusive use of students in the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science. In addition to your core maths modules, you gain computing knowledge of software including MATLAB and Maple.
* We host events and seminars throughout the year.

### Your future

We expect our graduates of MSc Actuarial Science to become actuaries in a range of industries. It has been predicted by the US Department of Labor that the employment of actuaries is expected to grow faster than any other occupation, making it a great prospect for a graduate job.

Aside from a rewarding career as an actuary, clear thinkers are required in every profession, so the successful mathematician has an extensive choice of potential careers. [The Council for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.mathscareers.org.uk/career-profiles) offers further information on careers in mathematics.

We additionally work with our [Employability and Careers Centre](http://www.essex.ac.uk/careers) to help you find out about further work experience, internships, placements, and voluntary opportunities.

We also offer supervision for PhD, MPhil and MSc by Dissertation. Our School is also strongly committed to research and to the promotion of graduate activities, we have an international reputation in many areas such as:

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

How is climate change linked to policy and policy makers? How does climate change impact upon the world's economies?

There is a rapidly growing need to understand the nature and consequences of the climate crisis, and to develop evidence-led strategies to respond. Our MA in Environmental Futures with Climate Change will provide you with rigorous training to better understand the causes and impact of climate change and to formulate strategies and solutions. The programme will provide you with knowledge of how climate change science is linked to policy and policy makers, and will develop a foundation to understand prevention of the climate crisis and mitigation/adaptation that is grounded in the social, natural and environmental sciences. You will learn the scientific evidence that is needed for policymakers and societies to respond to these global challenges impacting the natural capital and the world's economies.

You will also learn and apply the appropriate research methods to study the environment and climate change, and will be fully prepared and supported to conduct a dissertation project on a relevant topic. You will also be prepared to assess both quantitative and qualitative measurements and analyses and build your own datasets in the field of environmental policy.

You will also demonstrate proficiency in critical thinking, and written and oral communication, while understanding the context of environmental issues and the links between human and natural systems. The programme provides a strong foundation for PhD research, but is also ideal for employment in a wide range of public and private industries, including government agencies, consultancies and NGOs/charities.

If you like the sound of our MA Environmental Futures with Climate Change course but are particularly interested in quantitative analysis, complex data structures and multivariate hypothesis testing, the [MSc version](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg01406/2/msc-environmental-futures-with-climate-change) of this course may be for you.

Why we're great.

* You will gain a solid foundation in not just how environmental policy is approached from the social sciences but also from physical science as well
* Learn from and contribute to world-leading research in our top ranking politics department
* Consolidate an in-depth understanding of political studies and apply your knowledge to relevant real-world contexts

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 02: CORE

Comparative Environmental Politics

(15 CREDITS)

Study one of the most important contemporary societal and political issues that require urgent policy action: climate change. You consider the state of the natural environment and growing concerns related to the climate crisis. You will also explore environmental and climate policies, regarding how they shape and are shaped by individual attitudes, social movements, institutions, parties and international diplomacy.

COMPONENT 03: CORE

Climate Change and Pollution

(15 CREDITS)

Earth`s climate has fluctuated throughout history, but the speed of change in recent decades has been unprecedented. Warming, acidification, drought, flooding, and fire are increasingly prevalent features of our modern world.
In addition, humans are responsible for widespread environmental pollution, which is any input of material or energy into air, land, or water that causes harmful environment change.
The sources and ecological consequences of climate change and pollution will be explored and discussed, concentrating on biodiversity, species distributions and extinctions, and the provision of ecosystem services of benefit to humans.
Examples of climate change and pollution will be presented from both terrestrial and aquatic domains, and from polar to tropical biomes, together with a review of the avenues to be followed for remediation of biosphere processes and the conservation of biological diversity. The module will be delivered through lectures and a practical session incorporating data analysis and interpretation.

COMPONENT 04: CORE

International Environmental Politics

(15 CREDITS)

This module explores key elements of international environmental politics, the actors, means of cooperation, and its consequences. A lot of emphasis is given to the role of international environmental institutions as major actors of international environmental politics. In addition, we will explore climate change and some of its major consequences in international relations, namely, conflict and migration. The module also offers the opportunity to students to learn how to write a policy brief and a policy report. Such transferrable skills are highly demanded in the job market.

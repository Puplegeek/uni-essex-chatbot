[Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences)

We understand that you may not have time for a full-time degree, so our CPD pathways allow you to study flexibly in the way that best suits you. The structure, mode of delivery, and level of support allow you to progress towards a qualification at Masters level.

This pathway enables clinicians who have specialised in Hand Therapy to advance their practice. You engage with material related to clinical decision-making, clinical service quality improvement strategies, research methods, and advanced clinical skills such as injection therapy. You are also supported to undertake your own research project.

On this course, you gain:

* critical understanding of the key concepts underlying advanced musculoskeletal practice
* opportunity to acquire advanced musculoskeletal clinical skills beyond your normal professional scope of practice
* encouragement to contribute to policy-making, planning and evaluation
* a range of transferable employment-related skills
* skills to access and critically appraise research findings to develop your own evidence-based practice
* enhanced understanding of the essential principles of research design and support you to conduct an extensive piece of independent research, including: planning, formulating, designing, choosing research methods, collecting data, analysing, interpreting and writing-up

This course sits within our [School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences) This provides an exciting opportunity to join a community specifically focused on sports and exercise science, sports therapy and physiotherapy. This will allow us to bring together our internationally recognised research, share knowledge, and enhance placement and vocational opportunities for our students and graduates.

#### Professional, statutory and regulatory bodies

We are committed to embedding the [NHS Constitution Values](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england) (which are strongly reflected in our University values) into everything we do. They define the behaviours and expectations of all our staff and students underpinning the work we do in the university, clinical arena and other workplaces.

We understand that not all of our students and staff are employed within the NHS. But these values uphold the underlying principles of excellent care as a standard, and as such we expect that anyone who cares for others will aspire to uphold them.

For us, involving not only our students but service users, experts by experience, carers, and NHS/non-NHS professionals in the creation and delivery of all programmes is vital.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

COMPONENT 04: CORE

Current Concepts in Upper Limb Rehabilitation

(15 CREDITS)

This module is aimed at Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) working within the Musculoskeletal (MSK) field (including Hand Therapy) wishing to gain a greater understanding of current concepts in upper limb rehabilitation. This module is appropriate for clinicians working in both primary, secondary, and tertiary care.
The 'Multi-professional Advanced Clinical Practice (ACP) framework' was published in 2017 in response to ensure the long-term sustainability of the NHS. At the heart of this is development of a critical workforce role to deliver innovative models of care in a consistent way to ensuring safety, quality, and effectiveness. Core capabilities for health and care professionals are detailed in the framework, it is stated that:
'The language used to describe the capabilities is deliberately mapped to level 7 taxonomy to support and make clear the expectation that people working at this level are required to operate at master's level i.e. to have the ability to make sound judgements in the absence of full information and to manage varying levels of risk when there is complex, competing or ambiguous information or uncertainty.'
AHPs are central to the assessment and management of MSK conditions, their professional development towards advanced practice level supported by higher education institutions is essential to fulfilment of this vision. The framework sets out 4 key pillars of practice, each with a set of capabilities, this module and its assessment strategies aim to support professionals to evidence achievement of capability within these pillars.
Within the field of Hand Therapy educational routes to achievement of Accredited Hand Therapist qualification under the British Association of Hand Therapists (BAHT) and Advanced Practice in Hand Therapy include university-based masters modules. BAHT states:
'For a BAHT postgraduate education system to work and in order to increase the standing of Hand Therapy as a specialty in the United Kingdom we need to see more courses running.'
This module will add to Hand Therapists level 7 learning enabling them to work towards Advanced Practice status and provide additional options to achieve points towards the Accredited Hand Therapist qualification.
As most students are in full-time employment and located some distance to the University, this module enables remote study using e-learning technology, (Moodle) and remote tutorials via Zoom. The postgraduate musculoskeletal team at The University of Essex prioritises enabling study and minimising barriers; tutors will aim to be flexible with tutorial times and responsive to individual's clinical, professional, and personal circumstances.

COMPONENT 05: CORE

Medication Use in Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation

(15 CREDITS)

This course is aimed at experienced musculoskeletal practitioners, working at or towards Advanced Clinical Practitioners status. These clinicians who work in the field of musculoskeletal medicine will gain a greater understanding on the impact of medication on musculoskeletal rehabilitation. This module would be ideal for those working in primary, secondary and tertiary care and First Contact Practitioner roles.
Physiotherapists and other AHP’s working in the UK will be expected to give advice about medication use in some capacity to their patients. The type of advice and support given to patients will vary dependent on their status as either a non-prescriber, supplementary or independent prescriber. Clinicians who give advice about medication should understand the legislative framework underpinning quality assurances as well as its impact on musculoskeletal health and its role in rehabilitation of musculoskeletal conditions.
This module aims to support and develop critical thinking of practicing clinicians in understanding the impact of commonly prescribed medications on musculoskeletal health and its effects on rehabilitation. After completion of this course, students will have a grounded understanding of the impact of NSAID’s, analgesics and neuropathic pain medications on musculoskeletal tissue health and wider effects on rehabilitation. Students will also have increased knowledge and understanding of the legal and professional framework surrounding medicines legislation which will inform safe practice within their speciality.
This module is suitable for Advanced Clinical Practitioners and First Contact Physiotherapists. The learning aligns with HEE’s Multi-professional Advanced Clinical Practice Framework, A Roadmap to Practice and the Musculoskeletal Core Capability Framework (Domain C: Capability 8 Pharmacotherapy).
As most students are in full-time employment and located some distance to the university, this module enables remote study using e-learning technology, (Moodle) and remote tutorials via Zoom. The postgraduate musculoskeletal team at The University of Essex prioritises enabling study and minimising barriers; tutors will aim to be flexible with tutorial times and responsive to individual’s clinical, professional, and personal circumstances.
Applicants should have a relevant first degree OR a relevant professional experience or qualifications that demonstrates the ability to study at Level 7. A minimum of 1-year post-registration experience. Current Registration with the relevant UK or equivalent professional body Current registration with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) or equivalent (eg GMC for doctors and NMC for nurses).

Exceptionally it can be necessary to make changes, for example to courses, facilities or fees. Examples of such reasons might include, but are not limited to: strikes, other industrial action, staff illness, severe weather, fire, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack (whether declared or not), natural disaster, restrictions imposed by government or public authorities, epidemic or pandemic disease, failure of public utilities or transport systems or the withdrawal/reduction of funding. Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our [programme specifications](http://www.essex.ac.uk/programmespecs/). The University would inform and engage with you if your course was to be discontinued, and would provide you with options, where appropriate, in line with our Compensation and Refund Policy.*

*The full Procedures, Rules and Regulations of the University governing how it operates are set out in the Charter, Statutes and
Ordinances and in the University Regulations, Policy and Procedures.*

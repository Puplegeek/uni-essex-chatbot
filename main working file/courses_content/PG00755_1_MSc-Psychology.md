Do you have a desire to better understand how people think about, interact with, and experience the world around them?

Our MSc Psychology is an advanced fast-track conversion course for students with an undergraduate degree in a subject other than psychology, or for those whose undergraduate Psychology degree was not accredited by the British Psychological Society. You may also take the course as an end in itself if you wish to obtain a Psychology degree in one year.

Further study in our [Department of Psychology](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology) gives you the freedom and the facilities to study, experiment, explore, and research why we think, feel, and act the way we do. You will learn from and work alongside internationally renowned experts on a range of psychological topics, including:

* social psychology* developmental psychology* cognitive psychology* brain and behaviour* personality and individual differences* psychology of health

You will also gain a thorough education in psychological research methods and statistics.

Our departmental mission is to ['Understand our place in the world'](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/research), and our multi-method research approach is of particular value to this mission and to those who study with us. During your journey, you learn about the relevance of core psychology areas and that all psychology topics can be explored different lenses. At Essex, you explore how we [think about](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/research/thinking-about-the-world), [interact with](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/research/interacting-with-the-world), and [experience](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/research/experiencing-the-world) the world, offering fresh insights into the human mind and vehaviour from every angle. This dynamic, multi-perspective approach means you learn to investigate the full spectrum of psychological experiences in meaningful, real-world ways. We are committed to providing you with opportunities to grow, and as part of our one-year degree, you will also advance your skill set on how to devise, carry out, and analyse an empirical research project.

The course combines the award of a Masters with eligibility for graduates to apply for the Graduate Basis for Chartered Membership (GBC) of the British Psychological Society. Passing our course demonstrates that you have acquired an advanced understanding of Masters-level study in psychology. With this qualification, you will also be eligible to apply for professional training in any branch of professional psychology.

We are a warm and friendly Department with staff and students from many different backgrounds. We are proud of the multicultural mosaic that makes up our community. Our staff and students come from over 40 countries, bringing their own unique perspectives and experiences which enrich our teaching, learning, and research.

We wish to welcome both graduates who have recently completed their studies, and mature students who may wish to upgrade their qualifications, refresh their CV, or return to academic study after a period of time away. We are committed to diversity, inclusion, representation, and providing students with a curriculum that reflects the complexity of human behaviour worldwide.

You can study this course on a full-time or part-time basis, and start in either October or January.

### Professional accreditation

Accredited against the requirements for the Graduate Basis for Chartered Membership (GBC) of the British Psychological Society (BPS).

Why we're great.

* You may become eligible for graduate-basis chartered membership of the British Psychological Society.
* Gain full use of our virtual reality suites, babylab, and observation suites.
* We are 17th in UK for research power in psychology (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021).

### Our expert staff

The Department of Psychology at Essex supports world-leading, interdisciplinary research that promotes a better Understanding of Our Place in the World. This organisation of our research mission allows us to unite and synthesise knowledge across core psychology disciplines and beyond. To contribute to our mission, staff often dismantle conventional, disciplinary boundaries. This unique approach benefits from the use of multi-methodological approaches, while nurturing the translation of our research findings into practical tools that benefit society.

Our [academic staff](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/people/academic) include award-winning teachers and prize-winning researchers who are international experts in their own research areas. We are 17th in the UK for research power in psychology (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021). Our department is also expanding, and has recently appointed a number of excellent researchers whose expertise increases the diversity and depth of our skills base.

* We have a strong expertise of researchers who focus on the psychological underpinnings of individual and group-motivated behaviour and reasoning. Our work in this area brings together researchers applying different methodologies to study how people make decisions, remember, and feel and act, e.g. in the political arena and in health and disease. Staff have strong skills in experimental behavioural, electrophysiological, and neuromodulatory techniques.
* We also actively contribute to our understanding of how we perceive and present ourselves in relation to others, and how this affects our behaviour and well-being. Staff study individual and group processes that are fundamental to social relations and that address questions around social wellness, sexual and interpersonal relationships, and their links to identity and meaning of life, justice, and trust. They also focus on education, language, and cross-cultural processes and their interaction. Theme members use multiple methodologies, including self-report, behavioural observations, and (electro-)physiological measures to provide a wide-ranging look into the psychological processes underlying society's pressing issues and that guide our most important social interactions.
* Many of our staff and research students help to unravel the physiological and neural underpinnings of how we experience and perceive our body states, how we see, and how we control our actions. They further answer questions on how our perceptions and experiences change as we age. Infant and children work is conducted in our Essex Babylab, the leading infant lab in the East of England. Staff use a variety of techniques, including EEG, fNIRS, fMRI, TMS/tDCS, physiological and behavioural measures.

### Specialist facilities

We are committed to giving you access to [state-of-the-art facilities](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/facilities) in higher education, housed entirely within our purpose-built psychology building on our Colchester Campus:

* dedicated laboratories to employ a range of cutting-edge methodologies when carrying out your research projects* specialist areas to study visual and auditory perception, developmental psychology, and social psychology* a virtual reality suite and an observation suite* our Babylab, the leading infant lab in the East of England that explores perceptual, emotional, and cognitive processes in infants* our multimillion-pound Centre for Brain Science (CBS), which allows staff and students to investigate brain activity (including electrophysiology (EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)) and houses a range of facilities to measure eye movements and physiological responses (such as heart rate and skin conductance)* a first-of-its-kind dedicated [Minecraft Lab](https://60stories.essex.ac.uk/minecraft-the-power-of-play/index.html), which uses the popular game to study human behaviour in situations that might be impractical or unethical to recreate in the real world

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 01: CORE

MSc Psychology Research Project

(60 CREDITS)

This research dissertation is an empirical investigation which is written up with a 10,000 word-limit. The project provides students with an opportunity to apply the statistical and research skills learnt, in an original piece of research. The topic will be chosen from a selection offered by members of staff in the department.

[View MSc Psychology Research Project on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS900&year=25)

COMPONENT 02: CORE

Advanced Brain and Behaviour

(15 CREDITS)

Students will gain a wide understanding of the relationship between the human brain (and other physiological mechanisms) and behaviour. The brain is an extremely complex organ, and many areas of interest to psychologists are as yet, beyond the reductionist approach adopted here. However, the module is designed to establish the possibility that most behaviours, even our deepest thoughts and feelings, arise from a combination of electrical and chemical interactions in the central nervous system.

[View Advanced Brain and Behaviour on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS943&year=25)

COMPONENT 03: CORE

Advanced Personality and Individual Differences

(15 CREDITS)

This module gives students a detailed review of personality, intelligence and individual differences. It provides a parsimonious account of theories and approaches to personality and individual differences. Several areas of Psychology will be covered, including cognitive, trait theories and biological.

[View Advanced Personality and Individual Differences on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS945&year=25)

COMPONENT 04: CORE

Advanced Psychology of Health

(15 CREDITS)

This module combines the areas of medical and health psychology to explore the biological, psychological and social processes implicated in the development of ill health. We will address questions such as: What psychological processes are involved in modifying behaviours associated with health? How does disadvantage feed into negative health outcomes? Does living in line with our values improve well-being? How do people recognise symptoms in themselves and attribute them to illness? What is the link between early experience and brain development and parents' health-related behaviours? Questions will be addressed from different perspectives and will provide a comprehensive overview of how individuals think about health, how they experience health, and the role that social interactions play in this process.

[View Advanced Psychology of Health on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS951&year=25)

COMPONENT 05: CORE

Advanced Developmental Psychology

(15 CREDITS)

Explore classical and contemporary themes of child development such as prenatal and perceptual development, early language acquisition, and cognitive and social development, whilst examining the research methods and designs employed in Developmental Psychology.

[View Advanced Developmental Psychology on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS931&year=25)

COMPONENT 06: CORE

Advanced Cognitive Psychology

(15 CREDITS)

This module explores the basic cognitive processes involved in thinking about the world, interacting with the world, and experiencing the world. Often as users of these processes they just work and the complexity of the underlying operations are hidden; a kind of "user illusion". You will learn about the emerging scientific picture of how these basic processes operate, thereby gaining a better appreciation of the underlying complexity, and a renewed appreciation of the brilliance of these operations. The module will consider examples of human talents; such as bilingualism, as well as human limitations, such as our working memory capacities. The module will cover core areas of cognition as defined by the British Psychological Society such as perception, mental imagery, attention, memory, language, and consciousness. These will be discussed both with reference to laboratory-based experiments, and also how these processes may be disrupted and may breakdown in various conditions, such as dyslexia, amnesia, and other neuropsychological conditions. Finally, the lectures will address how basic cognitive processes apply to complex real-world behaviours.

[View Advanced Cognitive Psychology on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS952&year=25)

COMPONENT 07: CORE WITH OPTIONS

[PS953-7-AU or PS953-7-PS](https://www.essex.ac.uk/component/?componentID=d500a371-fe4f-4e17-b894-677d77d209db&headerImg=/-/media/header-images/subjects/psychology-subject-1200x600.jpg&lastYear=1&title=MSc%20Psychology)

(15 CREDITS)

COMPONENT 08: CORE

Advanced Social Psychology

(15 CREDITS)

By studying a range of theory and research surrounding human thinking and behaviour in a social world you will develop a clear understanding of the topics social psychologists are interested in and how they approach their study. You will also discover how theory and research in social psychology might help us to understand current issues in society.

[View Advanced Social Psychology on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS923&year=25)

COMPONENT 09: CORE

Research Methods in Psychology

(15 CREDITS)

This module will teach the background necessary to design, implement and report basic psychology research in order to test hypotheses and answer questions about human mind and behaviour. You will learn about a variety of techniques for studying behaviour within psychology. You will learn how to find, read and evaluate scientific research reports and to write your own.

[View Research Methods in Psychology on our Module Directory](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=PS954&year=25)

[Health and Social Care (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care)

Our integrated masters (MSci) is designed to develop your knowledge and skills in two different fields of nursing, Adult and Mental Health. You will spend the first 3 years studying your chosen field of nursing with the option to transfer to the MSci towards the end of the 3rd year. During the final and 4th year, your learning will focus on the alternate field of nursing to prepare you to manage the care of patients with more complex physical and mental health care needs and across a range of health care settings.

Our MSci is offered on a 4 year full-time basis, with teaching strategies including workshops, seminars and simulated practice sessions as provided in our [BSc Adult Nursing](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/ug00315/1/bsc-nursing-adult?startdate=2023/24) and [BSc Nursing Mental Health](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/ug00316/1/bsc-nursing-mental-health?startdate=2023/24)  programmes. The School of Health and Social Care has built a very strong and supportive relationship with key stakeholders and learning is enhanced with input from expert practitioners as well as service users with relevant lived experiences. Entry is flexible for BSc Nursing students to step-on following their third year (dependent on progression performance) and third year students can step-off before the final MSci qualifying year.

You are eligible to apply for the [NHS Learning Support Fund,](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-learning-support-fund-lsf) including training grants of £5000 per academic year to support weekly studies. You may also be eligible to receive an additional parental support of £2000. You can read the eligibility criteria and how to apply for funding at [www.healthcareers.nhs.uk](https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/)

The dual registration course accessed via Colchester and Southend Campus, with different campuses offering proximity to a variety of placement providers in acute Trusts, community settings, Private and Independent sector organisations. The course is accredited by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and on successful completion, you will be able to apply to register as both an Adult and Mental Health Nurse.

**Location**

You can choose to study this course at either our Colchester campus or our Southend campus - and your placements will correspond to the campus you choose. Colchester students will have placements in north Essex, while Southend students will have placements in south Essex.

Whilst this course is offered at both our Southend and Colchester campuses, we recommend that you consider which location would suit you best and apply for that campus. If you apply to multiple campuses, you will only have one interview and your chances of being offered a place will be the same as if you had only applied to one campus.

If you wish to change campus at any point during the admissions process then please contact your Admissions Adviser who will do their best to accommodate your preference. Changing campus is subject to availability.

**Making your application**

Before you make your application, take a look at our frequently asked questions section at the bottom of our undergraduate department pages. Here you will find hints and tips on what we are looking for, as well as useful resources to help you prepare for interviews.

**DBS and Occupational Health Checks**

This course requires a satisfactory Occupational Health Check and enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Check (including child and adult barred list check) - both of these are organised by the University. Please contact our DBS team or Occupational Health team if you have any questions in relation to these checks.

A satisfactory Overseas Criminal Record Check/Local Police Certificate is also required, in addition to a DBS Check, where you have lived outside of the UK in the last 5 years for 6 months or more. Further information about how to obtain an Overseas Criminal Record check can be found on the Gov.uk website.

**Mandatory Vaccinations**

As you may be aware, the UK government has now revoked legislation that requires all health and social care staff working in sites regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Whilst vaccination is not essential, we encourage our applicants and students to be fully vaccinated. [Find out more about what this means for applicants to this course.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care/undergraduate#vaccination-and-studying-in-our-school)

### Professional accreditation

Recognised by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) for the purpose of registration as a qualified nurse (adult).

Recognised by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) for the purpose of registration as a qualified nurse (mental health).

Why we're great.

* 97% of our School of Health and Social Care UG graduates are in employment or further study (Graduate Outcomes 2023).
* Our focus is on producing nurses with empathy as well as technical skill.
* Much of your study is spent in clinical settings, working alongside nurses and other professionals.

### Study abroad

Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The five-year version of our course allows you to spend the third year abroad, otherwise remaining identical to the four-year course. Read more about [how our integrated masters programmes work here.](https://www.essex.ac.uk/undergraduate/integrated-masters)

Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.

If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university

### Placement year

Half of your studies will be spent working in clinical settings – for example, in a ward, a health centre or in client's homes. You will be working alongside nurses as you practice and perfect your skills. Placements are based in NHS, private and voluntary settings throughout Essex. You will work shift patterns whilst in placement equivalent to approximately a 37.5 hour week. This includes early shifts, late shifts, night shifts, weekend and bank holiday working. Placements will be across a range of physical and mental health care settings.

### Our expert staff

We specialise in applied, multidisciplinary research that addresses issues of national and international concern to health and social care policy and practice and related fields. We also host the [NIHR Research Design Service for the East of England.](https://arc-eoe.nihr.ac.uk/)

You will be prepared to support service users with a range of physical and mental health care needs. You will engage with people with lived experiences, clinicians within practice learning and academic experts at the university to shape your progress towards registration as an adult and mental health nurse, and potential nursing leader of the future.

Programme leader - Christine Daley-Fennell has over 26 years experience as a Registered General Nurse, with expertise in Renal /Haemodialysis Nursing. She has worked within various clinical and academic capacities within the NHS and overseas. She has a keen interest in the assessment and supervision of students in clinical practice, all aspects of kidney care and the management of long term conditions.

### Specialist facilities

The School of Health and Social Care is located at two sites; in the Kimmy Eldridge building at our Colchester campus and in the Gateway Building at our Southend campus.

We have purpose-built nursing skills labs at both our Colchester and Southend campuses to meet the needs of a growing and lively School. View our image gallery and find out more about our  [nursing facilities](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care/facilities#nursing_facilities).

Our dedicated support tutor will help to develop your academic literacy and clinical numeracy skills. This helps you apply these critically important areas of study to real life situations.

### Your future

The School has a successful history of contributing to the local, regional and national nursing workforce through our nursing courses including the former MSc in nursing course. We graduate staff as capable and proficient caring professionals, compassionate leaders and applied clinical scientists.

### English language requirements

**English language requirements for applicants whose first language is not English:**  IELTS 7.0 overall with a minimum of 6.5 in writing and 7.0 in all other components, or specified score in another equivalent test that we accept.

Details of English language requirements, including component scores, and the tests we accept can be found [here](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/documents/admissions/hscIeltsAndEquivalents.pdf)

If we accept the English component of an international qualification it will be included in the academic levels listed above for the relevant countries.

**English language shelf-life**

Most English language qualifications have a validity period of 5 years. The validity period of Pearson Test of English, TOEFL and CBSE or CISCE English is 2 years.

If you require a Student visa to study in the UK please see our [immigration webpages](https://www.essex.ac.uk/international/immigration-and-visas) for the latest Home Office guidance on English language qualifications.

If you do not meet our IELTS requirements then you may be able to complete a [pre-sessional English pathway](https://www.essex.ac.uk/international/pre-sessional) that enables you to start your course without retaking IELTS.

**Pending English language qualifications**

You don’t need to achieve the required level before making your application, but it will be one of the conditions of your offer.

If you cannot find the qualification that you have achieved or are pending, then please email [ugquery@essex.ac.uk](mailto:ugquery@essex.ac.uk).

### Additional Notes

## Structure

### Course structure

Our Nursing programmes consist of three terms per year. This structure adopts a developmental approach to the mastering of nursing skills and development of knowledge and understanding. It has a 50:50 split between theory and practice which means that for 50% of your programme, you undertake clinical practice by working with nurses in a variety of settings (primary and secondary care, public and private sectors, adult and the elderly, acute care and specialist services). Service user-centred care planning emphasises the holistic nature of health and illness. Alongside this experience, you are given the opportunity to rehearse practical skills in a controlled environment further preparing you for working in the practice environment.

As you undertake a significant part of your programme in placement areas we work in partnership with the NHS and the independent health and social care sector across Essex where you will spend your placement hours so that you gain the best clinical learning experiences. Whilst on placement you will have a Practice Supervisor allocated to you and contact with a Practice Assessor linked to that placement. You will work shift patterns whilst in placement equivalent to a 37.5 hour week. This includes early shifts, late shifts, night shifts, weekend and bank holiday working.

Attendance at all parts of this programme is compulsory (as are the modules you study) and must be evidenced in order to register as a nurse.

These carefully selected modules will give you the chance to explore, question, and create powerful ideas. Picked to give you an extensive and in-depth education, they'll equip you with the specialist knowledge, vital transferrable skills, and the confidence to make a genuine difference to the world around you.

We're reactive, we're pioneering, we never stand still, so modules might change from year to year in response to new developments and innovation. Those listed below show how a typical course might look, but more detail on course structure, including details of all optional modules, is available on our [Programme Specification](http://www.essex.ac.uk/programmespecs).

*We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.*

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

Nursing students are required to gain experience of the range of hours that nurses work and will be expected to follow the shift patterns worked in a range of clinical departments.

## Structure

### Course structure

Our dedicated support tutor will help to develop your academic literacy and clinical numeracy skills. This helps you apply these critically important areas of study to real life situations.

The course is available on a part- or full-time basis.

Full-time has 180 credits corresponding to 1800 hours of learning (including self-directed learning). Part-time study corresponds to 900 hours across the academic year.

A combination of lectures, seminars, tutorials and small group teaching sessions focus on the core content of the curriculum. Self-directed learning requires a further 3 days per week.

Components and modules explained

#### Components

Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Status | What this means |
| **Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted. |
| **Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |
| **Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail. |

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.

#### Modules

Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

| HR | 100 | 4 | FY |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The department or school the module will be taught by.  In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number. | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module.  A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.  A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.  A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.   * **AU**: Autumn term * **SP**: Spring term * **SU**: Summer term * **FY**: Full year * **AP**: Autumn and Spring terms * **PS:** Spring and Summer terms * **AS:** Autumn and Summer terms |

COMPONENT 07: COMPULSORY

Survey Research Methods

(15 CREDITS)

A survey is a form of structured enquiry that collects similar information on each member of a sample or population (of people, households or physical objects e.g. houses) from existing documents, self-completed questionnaires, interviews or observations with a view to drawing scientific conclusions about social (including health-related) issues.
Health surveys are cross-sectional studies and can be used to collect data longitudinally, over time. They are useful in a variety of research methods including semi structured interviews, Health-related Quality of Life outcome measurement tools and other types of questionnaires.

COMPONENT 08: COMPULSORY

Health Economics

(15 CREDITS)

This module focuses on the technique of economic evaluation. As resources are scarce choices need to be made about how to best allocate those scarce resources. Given resources are finite provision of one option means there is less resource that can be spent elsewhere and as such another option will likely have to be sacrificed (i.e., there is generally an opportunity cost associated with the provision of a particular health care intervention as it means another intervention will not be provided). Economic evaluation typically compares the costs and benefits of different health care interventions with a view to establish which intervention is more cost-effective i.e., which intervention offers value for money and should therefore be provided (at the expense of another intervention which would not be provided).
The module will outline the different types of economic evaluation, and explain the steps of identification, measurement and valuation of both costs and outcomes. It will include applied work where students would be able to use hypothetical data to estimate costs based on different levels of resource use e.g., the number of visits to different types of health professionals, and outcomes based on reported quality of life data. Exercises would be developed in e.g., Microsoft Excel / STATA. The analysis performed on such estimated cost and outcome data in order estimate levels of cost-effectiveness/value for money will also be covered. The use of critical appraisal to assess the quality of the economic evidence and use of recommended reporting checklists/standards will also be outlined.

COMPONENT 09: COMPULSORY WITH OPTIONS

[HS900-7-AT or HS633-7-SP](https://www.essex.ac.uk/component/?componentID=04c96ed5-d823-41ce-a2a6-3de00f36d12b&headerImg=/-/media/header-images/faculty-of-science-and-health/health-and-social-care/hsc-nurse-%281%29.png&lastYear=1&title=MRes%20Health%20and%20Care%20Research)

(15 CREDITS)

### Placement

Placements with established researchers or research groups are carefully tailored to the student’s professional background. The placement provides first-hand experience of undertaking research in the real world.

### Teaching

The course is delivered using small-group teaching sessions, seminars, applied workshops and a research placement, where you work as a member of an established clinical, health or care-based research team to practise your emergent expertise in a real-world practicum.

### Assessment

The formal assessments are in the form of written assignments, generally with a 2000-4000 word written format.

### Dissertation

The dissertation is an extended piece of scholarship of students choosing and should be based on a piece of research that they structure and lead. Dissertations offer the opportunity for in-depth study and analysis of a topic relevant to the Master’s degree programme. It gives students the chance to pursue a topic that they are interested in and to develop research their independent study skills.

The dissertation comprises one-third of the credits on the MRes. Students are expected to demonstrate the ability to engage critically and analytically with literature in the field, building upon relevant concepts and theory covered in the taught element of the degree.

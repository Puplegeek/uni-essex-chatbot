## Overview
The details 
Course:  Data Science with Professional Placement
Start date:  October 2025
Study mode:  Full-time
Duration:  2 years
Location:  Colchester Campus
Based in:  [Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science (School of)](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science)
The techniques we use to model and manipulate data guide the political, financial, and social decisions that shape our modern society and are the basis of economy growth and business success. Technology is growing and evolving at an incredible speed, and the growth rate of both the data we generate and the devices we use to process it can only increase.
Data science is a growing and important field of study with an increasing number of jobs and opportunities within both the private and public sectors. The application of theory and methods to real-world problems is at the core of data science, which aims especially to use and exploit big data.
If you are interested in solving real-world problems, like to develop skills to use smart devices efficiently, want to use and to foster your understanding of mathematics, and keen to use statistical techniques and methods to interpret data, MSc Data Science at Essex is for you. You study a balance of solid theory and practical application, including:
  * computer science 
  * programming 
  * statistics 
  * data analysis 
  * probability 


A successful career in data science requires you to possess truly interdisciplinary knowledge, so we ensure that you graduate with a wide-ranging yet specialised set of skills in this area. You are taught mainly within our [School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematics-statistics-and-actuarial-science) and our [School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering), but also benefit from input from our [Essex Business School](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-business-school) and our [Essex Pathways Department](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/essex-pathways). Data scientists are required in every sector, carrying out statistical analysis or mining data on social media, so our course can open the door to almost any industry, from health, to government, to publishing.
Our School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science is genuinely innovative and student-focused. Our research groups are working on a broad range of collaborative areas tackling real-world issues.
  * Our data scientists carefully consider how not to lie, and how not to get lied to with data. Interpreting data correctly is especially important because much of our data science research is applied directly or indirectly to social policies, including health, care and education. 
  * We do practical research with financial data (for example, assessing the risk of collapse of the UK's banking system) as well as theoretical research in financial instruments such as insurance policies or asset portfolios. 
  * We also research how physical processes develop in time and space. Applications of this range from modelling epilepsy to modelling electronic cables. 
  * Our optimisation experts work out how to do the same job with less resource, or how to do more with the same resource. 
  * Our pure maths group are currently working on two new funded projects entitled ‘Machine learning for recognising tangled 3D objects' and ‘Searching for gems in the landscape of cyclically presented groups'. 
  * We also do research into mathematical education and use exciting technologies such as electroencephalography or eye tracking to measure exactly what a learner is feeling. Our research aims to encourage the implementation of ‘the four Cs' of modern education, which are critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. 


You can start this course in October or January.
Why we're great. 
  * We are committed to developing the data scientists of the future.
  * Our interdisciplinary Institute for Data Analytics (IADS) researches data issues from the scientific and technological, to the sociological and legal.
  * We have active links with industry to broaden your employment potential and placement opportunities.


### Placement year
MSc Data Science with Professional Placement offers a unique opportunity for you to gain relevant work experience within an external business or organisation, giving you a competitive edge in the job market and providing you with key contacts within the industry. The placement is undertaken between the taught part of the course and the individual project.

Components and modules explained
#### Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status | What this means  
---|---  
**Core** | You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.  
**Core with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.  
**Compulsory** | You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.  
**Compulsory with Options** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.  
**Optional** | You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.  
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
#### Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the [module code](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/codes.aspx). For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR | 100 |  4 |  FY  
---|---|---|---  
The department or school the module will be taught by. In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History. | The module number.  | The [UK academic level](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) of the module. A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course. A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules. A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification. | The term the module will be taught in.

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY 
Machine Learning 
(15 CREDITS) 
Humans can often perform a task extremely well (e.g., telling cats from dogs) but are unable to understand and describe the decision process followed. Without this explicit knowledge, we cannot write computer programs that can be used by machines to perform the same task. “Machine learning” is the study and application of methods to learn such algorithms automatically from sets of examples, just like babies can learn to tell cats from dogs simply by being shown examples of dogs and cats by their parents. Machine learning has proven particularly suited to cases such as optical character recognition, dictation software, language translators, fraud detection in financial transactions, and many others.

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY 
Data Visualisation 
(15 CREDITS) 
In a world increasingly driven by data, the need for analysis and visualisation is more important than ever. In this module you will look at data through the eyes of a numerical detective. You will work on the lost art of exploratory data analysis, reviewing appropriate methods for data summaries with the aim to summarise, understand, extract hidden patterns and identify relationships. You will then work on graphical data analysis, using simple graphs to understand the data, but also advanced complex methods to scrutinise data and interactive plots to communicate data information to a wider audience. For data analysis and visualisations you will use R-studio, and a combination of R-shiny applications and google visualisations for interactive plotting.

### Placement
You will complete a professional placement between the taught part of the course and the individual project. This professional placement allows you to gain work experience during your postgraduate studies.
### Teaching
  * Postgraduate taught students in the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science typically attend two hours of lectures and one class or lab every week, but this will vary by module. 
  * Core components can be combined with optional modules to gain either in-depth specialisation or a broad understanding. 
  * Learn to use LATEX to produce a document as close as possible to those produced by professional mathematicians in terms of organisation, layout, and type-setting. 
  * Our postgraduates are encouraged to attend conferences and seminars. 


### Assessment
  * Courses are assessed on the results of your written examinations, together with continual assessments of your practical work and coursework. 


### Dissertation
  * You will be provided with a list of dissertation titles or topics proposed by staff, though it may be possible to propose a project of your own. 
  * Most dissertations are between 10,000 and 30,000 words in length. However, these are guidelines rather than mandatory word counts. 
  * Study with close supervision by our academic staff. 


## Fees and funding
### Home/UK fee
£10,500 per year
Year 2 fee is currently calculated at 40% of the Year 1 fee for the year in which the placement occurs.
